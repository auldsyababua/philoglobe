Inventing Knowledge 
 
A Global & Historical Introduction to Philosophy 
 
Emmie Malone 






Preface 
 
This book is designed to serve as an open educational resource (OER)
textbook for a cross-cultural Introduction to Philosophy course in the style of a
historical survey. While it was written with an undergraduate academic audience in mind, it should also be suitable for self-guided readers interested in philosophy. It
covers ‘western’ philosophy from the Presocratics of Ancient Greece through to the
present day (and including the Islamic world). It also contains additional chapters on
philosophy in India, China, Mesoamerica, and Africa. The text touches on issues concerning, but not limited to, metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political
philosophy, philosophy of religion, and aesthetics. While many important figures
were cut for the sake of brevity, upon working through the material covered here,
students should be able to identify and discuss many of the central figures, concepts, problems, theories, and schools of philosophy across history and around the world.
 
As anyone who teaches a historical survey course knows, there is an inherent
tension between adequately covering ‘the canon’ and avoiding reifying its biases. We
cover certain regions and figures because they are what students will hear about in
subsequent courses, but students hear about them in subsequent courses because that is what was covered when that professor was a student. Students reading this
text should, in the end, be conversant with regards to the ideas and figures they are
likely to engage with in their
 
further study of philosophy (and which they were historically expected to learn
about in an introductory course) but, at the same time, not inherit the traditionally
skewed view of who philosophy is done by and who the field is for.

edition will be made available in print, digital text, audio, and video formats. Meanwhile, minor revisions made between the release of new editions will be issued
as new versions. Each new version will only be made available in digital text format.
 
ii Older editions will remain available in all formats through the textbook website. This will allow any instructor who adopts this text as their textbook to continue to 
assign, access, and use a particular edition should they prefer it. This website will also
detail the changes made for each new version and edition. Instructors are encouraged to consult the textbook website for the most current version of the text.
 
In addition to housing the various formats of this text, which may be useful
in teaching from it, the textbook website will also house a number of other free
OER teaching supplements and additional resources. First, there is Waves of 
Thought: A Global & Historical Reader, a primary source reader designed to accompany this textbook. The reader features primary source readings arranged and
edited to correspond to each chapter of this textbook. Instructors are invited to
assign the reader in addition to or in place of this textbook. While the reader was
created with classroom instruction in mind, self-learners are also invited to read and use it as well. Second, the textbook website also houses lecture slides corresponding
to each chapter of the textbook. Readers can also find an interactive electronic
timeline of the figures discussed in this text available on the website. Finally, a
multiple-choice question and answer bank is also available for free to instructors by

Acknowledgements 
 
I would like to thank all those who made this project possible.
Chronologically, the first of which was P.D. Magnus, who provided early guidance
and inspiration on making OER resources and on navigating the use of public
domain and creative commons resources. He also gave critical advice in the late stages of this project. The text also benefited from early recommendations and
feedback by Elizabeth Cantalamessa, Mark Thorsby, and Cambria Stamper.
 
I would also like to thank Peter Adamson (whose History of Philosophy 
without any Gaps podcast and book series were incredibly valuable resources
throughout the writing of this book), Mary Ellen Waithe (whose A History of 
 
iii Women Philosophers book series was equally invaluable), Margaret L. King and 
Albert Rabil Jr. (whose book series, The Other Voice in Early Modern Europe, was a
tremendous boon to this project), and the Center for the History of Women
Philosophers and Scientists (whose ongoing projects and video lecture series were a fantastic resource as well). Similar things could be said of every author mentioned in
the bibliography of this book. I thank them all for their ongoing and excellent work
in the history of philosophy.
 
On a more personal level, I would also like to thank all of my friends and
family for their support throughout this project. Among these, Vasavi Kanneganti and Colin Aulds stand out as especially deserving of recognition, as they provided
much more frequent and in-depth support and guidance on the project than could
reasonably ever be asked for. The same could be said for Kim, Victoria, and Steve
Daylor.
 
Despite the best efforts of all of these people, some errors may remain
within the text. All of these mistakes are entirely the fault of the author, and readers
are encouraged to contact the author so that they can be revised in future editions.

About the Author  805 







For my mom, 
who did everything so that I could do anything, 
and who wove both love and wisdom into the fabric of my life.







“In some remote corner of the universe,
poured out and glittering in innumerable solar systems,
there once was a star on which clever animals invented knowledge.
That was the highest and most mendacious minute in ‘world history’
– yet only a minute.”
- Friedrich Nietzsche 







Introduction 
 
If you were asked, right now, to describe the way that the world works and
what the world is (in the broadest senses of the term), you are likely to use a common
language to describe it. For instance, in a science classroom, we often talk about species, elements, atoms, substances, causes, forces, and laws. What’s more, you
might think that these concepts are the obvious building blocks of any good
explanation of reality. After all, how could we really describe our universe without
appealing to these ideas? The same is true for the task of characterizing your own inner life. In doing so, you’re liable to start saying things about sensations and
perceptions, beliefs and desires, and reasons for acting. Further, if you were pressed
on why you think that the stories you’re telling are true, you might even appeal to
the meanings of words or to what must necessarily be the case. For most of us, it would be hard to imagine thinking about the world without thinking about it in this 
way. Could things have been different? Could we have lived on our planet and lived
human lives like our own without thinking of cause and effect as we do, or without
thinking about our actions in terms of forming intentions and providing justifications? The ease with which we simply assume our present way of thinking
about things can make our models of the world seem natural, self-evident, or even
inevitable. This is a mistake. We are the heirs to all the ages of human life, and the
concepts we now employ were brought about through hard intellectual work. Not
only could things have been different, they once were. Knowing this shows us that they are likely to be different again.
 
As strange as it may sound, our own current point of view can be thought of
as a technology which was invented like any other. Like all other technological
innovation, it is the result of generations of people refining what came before them. Also like all other technological innovations, it is likely not in its final stage, and it is
 
1 certainly not perfect. Something of what we think today will be preserved by future
generations and something will be overturned. Yet, if we knew today what will be
overturned tomorrow, then we would no longer think it now. It is by looking at the
past and understanding the reasons which pushed people towards our current way of thinking that we become better equipped to evaluate our common beliefs, ideas, and
assumptions. In this way, the history of philosophy attempts to give us an account of
the invention of our own point of view. It is the story of the growth of humanity's
ability to understand the universe and ourselves. In much the same way, this text
aims to give a somewhat unified and comprehensive view of this growth. The history of philosophy invites us to look at life and at the world without our current
prejudices and free from our current problems. It illuminates the radical contingency
of human knowledge and reveals the many meandering paths of the mind which
became evident to us at some point, but which we have so far left unexplored. So too, by coming to understand the history of philosophy, can we begin to get a sense
of how much of intellectual work is still left to do, and how much of what seems
obvious to us today is likely to be overturned tomorrow. Determining what ideas
and models of the world will be overturned, and what they will be replaced with, is an exercise left for the reader.
 
What is Philosophy? 
 
Any attempt to define philosophy is, undoubtedly, controversial. This is
because there are a great many ways of doing philosophy and because philosophy is
not confined to some one particular domain the way that, say, biology is said to be the study of life. The word ‘philosophy’ is derived from an Ancient Greek word
(‘philosophia’) meaning ‘love of wisdom’. However, this doesn’t really tell us much.
Surely, after all, the physicists love wisdom as well. Worse still, while philosophy is
offered as a college major alongside biology and physics, philosophy is actually more like science in general than it is like either of these. It is a massive and varied body of
ways of interrogating reality and of kinds of knowledge. What, then, can we say
about it? At the very least, philosophers are in the business of raising questions,
 
2 forming theories which address those questions, and providing reasons for accepting
or rejecting those theories. As we will see, what this activity looks like can vary wildly
throughout time and across the world. Another thing that can be said of philosophy
is that it tends to be (but is not exclusively) concerned with abstract sorts of questions; about how we ought to think about reality, ourselves, beauty, goodness,
knowledge and reason, and our duties to one another. While, at one point, this
project used to include the whole of science as well, since science has spun off into its
own discipline, philosophers tend to focus on questions of meaning and value, on
reconciling these things with the emerging picture of reality offered to us by scientists, or on embedding themselves within the sciences and helping to work out
conceptual puzzles. While this seems generally true, again, there are a great many
exceptions to everything that is stated here. Finally, philosophers tend to build off of
what has come before them, responding to figures from the near or distant past. In this way, philosophy is one of, if not the, longest running collaborative intellectual
projects in human history.
 
These chains, of philosophers building off of, responding to, or rejecting the
thinkers which come before them, form traditions. Importantly, there is not one tradition of philosophy. Philosophy emerged in different ways in different places,
and when societies were more isolated than they are today. However, they were not
entirely isolated. If we were to draw out each of these timelines, with their unique
starting points and trajectories, like lines of string, we could watch them sprout forth from, split apart from, and bounce off of one another; sometimes merging, even if
only momentarily. More beautiful, still, than this image, is the promise of a future in
which these various threads interact with one another with such frequency and
intensity that they are woven together into a single yarn. While this yarn may be
frayed at its ends (a reflection of the various distinct starting points), the final product would be stronger and more resilient than any individual thread. This yarn
is the human intellectual tradition, and it is the endowment of every individual
human.
 
While philosophy is not defined by a particular topic, it can be subdivided into a number of categories which have historically and do currently make it up.
First, there is metaphysics. This is the study of the fundamental nature of reality.
Metaphysicians (those that study metaphysics) ask and answer questions about being
 
3
(ontology), time, reality, existence, the self, the mind, cause and effect, and necessity
(among others). Second, there is value theory (or axiology). This is a broad category of study, which concerns goodness and badness. Within value theory, we might ask
what a good government or citizen does (political philosophy), what good artists, artworks, audiences, and experiences do (aesthetics), or about the nature of good
actions and good people (ethics). Third, we have epistemology, which concerns the nature of knowledge, reason, justification, belief, and evidence. We might also
include formal logic within epistemology (though some make it a category of its
own). Formal logic is the rigorous analysis of the ways in which we reason, and it includes the various attempts to express that reasoning more clearly and
systematically. Finally, we have the history of philosophy. Where historians (in the
traditional sense) study the things that have happened and why they have happened,
historians (as a subset of philosophers) study the ways and things people have thought and why.
 
More recently, and discussed at the end of the book, philosophers have
branched out further into the domains of other disciplines, applying the skill set of
philosophy to help resolve problems in those areas. We can call this ‘applied philosophy’. Currently, there are applied philosophers doing philosophy of
language, biology, physics, religion, cognitive science, race, gender, and games, along
with work on many more topics. It is important to point out two things about
applied philosophy. First, this work is usually still describable in one of the ways mentioned above. For instance, a philosopher of art might work on the metaphysics
of artworks, on aesthetics, or on the ethics of art. The same can be said for the other
fields of applied philosophy. Second, applied philosophy is actually nothing new.
Philosophers have long concerned themselves with questions about biology, art,
religion, and politics (to name a few). This is all just to say that it can be helpful to know these categories in order to situate yourself within the field, but they are also
porous and there is no one agreed upon way to account for every branch of
philosophy.

The Value of Philosophy 
 
If philosophy can generally be thought of as a messy heap of rather abstract
theorizing about fundamental questions, we might wonder why we should bother
studying it at all? Hasn’t science made philosophy obsolete? Indeed, science is
exciting because it gets things done. Science allows us to invent new gadgets, we can
create companies to sell those gadgets, and we can get rich from selling those gadgets. Philosophy, by contrast, sometimes seems to amount to mere navel-gazing and
wordplay. It asks questions we can’t solve and distracts us from solving those we can
(or so the story goes). It is certainly true that science does produce plenty of great
gadgets, which is great for all of us. It is equally true that studying science can allow us to advance our career and our income, as well as our understanding of how the
physical world works. This all seems to raise the question of whether philosophy is,
as science appears to be, uniquely valuable for us as a society and as individuals.
 
We can start with the first question. As we have already seen, our concepts are a technology, and those concepts are invented in the laboratory of philosophy,
not science. Sure, scientists can tell us that they discovered a new species, that Pluto
isn’t a planet, and how things work in the world. However, science can’t tell us
whether we are justified in believing in science in the first place (and why), whether thinking in terms of ‘species’ is the correct way of thinking about animal life,
whether we ought to spend taxpayer money to send a satellite to Pluto, or what it
means to be a thing at all. These questions require some amount of philosophizing in
order to answer. Further still, included among the concepts invented by philosophers
is science itself, along with the various sciences. Before there was a physics, there was natural philosophy. Before there was a psychology, there was philosophy of mind.
Science surely makes great intellectual progress, but this is not a problem for
philosophy. In a certain sense, science is only able to advance precisely because
philosophy does not. Philosophy on a given topic represents our best efforts to understand that thing given that there is absolutely no agreement on what an answer
would look like or how to arrive at one. Philosophy is, in essence, inquiry under
conditions of radical uncertainty. Nevertheless, philosophers argue their respective
cases until one model for solving the problem presents itself as especially promising. Competing thinkers then come together and run the tests offered by that model and
 
5 a science is born. The sciences, too, are conceptual technologies and they, too, were
invented in the laboratory of philosophy. Science, then, is valuable for inventing
things, while philosophy is valuable for inventing concepts and sciences.
Accordingly, someone should study science if they want to be on the forefront of the new thing business and they should study philosophy if they want to be on the
forefront of the new science business. While one is certainly more practical than the
other, it would seem that both are valuable to society and one person can happily
study both.
 
However, we can say more about the value of philosophy and, in doing so, learn about its unique value for those who study it. In a book filled with
controversial statements, the next may be the most: there simply is more to life than
advancing one’s career and income. This isn’t to say that those things aren’t worth
doing or that they won’t make life easier in some important ways. Focusing on practical matters is sure to help with practical problems, and we all definitely have
plenty of them. However, we also all have other sorts of problems. For instance, it is
easier for the rich person to buy caviar and jet skis than it is for the poor person, but
caring only for what is practical will not make the passing of a loved one any easier. Studying philosophy isn’t about choosing between being practical or not. It is about
preparing ourselves for our all too human lives. It is a safeguard which works to
ensure that the life we so desperately and practically work to improve is worth all of
that work.
 
This isn’t to say that philosophy will settle the matter of the meaning of life the way that science might settle the matter of the atomic weight of argon (39.948 u).
While many philosophers and students of philosophy have been convinced of
particular answers to philosophical problems, and many have found meaning in
those answers, this is not necessary to find the working out of these questions valuable. Science can give us specific and seemingly certain answers. Philosophy,
meanwhile, is valuable because of (not in spite of) its radical and fundamental
uncertainty. We are ever and always pushed to merely go along with life. Habit,
tradition, social expectations, education, government, and marketing all push us constantly towards accepting, without reflection, what seems obvious to everyone
else. The very idea of expecting certain answers to our most important questions is,
itself, a negation of the life of the mind. Once we have decided that science, the law,
 
6 or common sense have settled the matter, we can wash our hands of it. Why do we
believe x? Because science says it’s so. Why do we do y? Because the law says we must.
What is certain leaves us no choice. The facts are simply the facts, and we are told
that we must accept them. Likewise, we can be tempted, ourselves, to accept them because it absolves us of our responsibility in the matter. However, in the space of
radical uncertainty, we must decide for ourselves which problems seem tractable,
which efforts seem worthwhile, and which projects ought to define our lives. Making
choices within the space of uncertainty, taking responsibility for those choices, and
building a unique point of view brick by brick, from our accomplishments and mistakes, is the stuff of life. In this way, the more we know of philosophy, the more
territory we have to explore and the more tools we have to cultivate it. We can accept
an impoverished life within the fishbowl of certainty, or we push beyond the limits
of what is obvious and stake a claim on our own unique plot of land and from our own unique point of view; this is what it means to do philosophy.
 
In this way, philosophy’s fundamental ambiguity allows us the possibility of
developing into true agents. In philosophy, we need not enter the classroom
expecting to be filled up with the same diet of facts that are fed to others. Yet, at the same time, philosophy invites us to think beyond ourselves. Our present way of
thinking is not obviously true, and our personal interests are not obviously worth
pursuing. Others have thought differently than us and many of them with good
reason. Studying philosophy makes encountering a good question as satisfying as coming across a good answer, and it makes hearing a good defense of a view we
disagree with more rewarding than being told that we were already right. Philosophy
makes inhabiting one’s head a little easier, a little more fun, and even a little exciting
(which is convenient because we probably aren’t moving out any time soon).
Philosophy, too, makes our attempts to understand one another more tolerable and enriching.
 
Practical matters can enrich our social lives. We can study engineering in
order to get a good job and afford nice things. We can be happy using those things so
long as others are around, so long as our political environment is stable, and so long as there is gas in the tank of the jet ski. Philosophy, though, makes our happiness
resilient. It enriches our private lives. In studying philosophy, we can better enjoy the
time after everyone at the party has gone home, while we await an unjust
 
7 punishment in prison, or while we lie in bed alone at night. Every person will, at
some point in their life, be left alone with only the contents of their own mind, and
the facts revealed by science will be exhausted quickly. The technologies of
philosophy furnish the mind with something worth doing even in our quietest and most personal moments. These furnishings also give us something to grab on to
when we find ourselves reeling from life, and they allow us to connect with one
another in a deeper way. At the very least, if none of this is sufficient to motivate the
skeptical reader, you can at least take comfort in knowing that, by studying
philosophy, you just might accidentally invent the next physics.
 
Philosophy & Matters of Opinion 
 
A question which often arises when discussing philosophical matters is
whether the whole debate isn’t, in the end, just a matter of opinion. After all, who’s
to say what is really true or good, beautiful or reasonable? Who’s to say what is even
real? While this question naturally comes up all the time in philosophy, it also confuses a few issues which we can now try to untangle at the outset.
 
First, we should say that every person is, in fact, entitled to their opinion.
Each reader, just as each philosopher is, and ought only to be, permitted to decide for
themselves what they are to believe. Indeed, nowhere is this more cherished than within philosophy. As we have already said, philosophy encourages you to decide
totally for yourself which space you should occupy within the intellectual landscape.
Of course, the arguments of others may push or pull you from your conceptual
hidey hole, but this can and should only happen due to the treachery of your own
reason, which is more than capable of betraying your preconceptions and allying itself with the outside force of someone else’s stronger argument. Yet, it is one thing
to say that we all should and do have a right to make up our own minds about
philosophical issues, and it is another to say that we are all entitled to be right.
 
The claim that all of philosophy is ultimately just a matter of opinion is not just one about what we are allowed to do, but what we are rationally justified in
 
8 doing. Namely, it is the claim that we can never be wrong about our philosophical
views and, at the same time, can never have better reason for what we hold to be true
than anyone else. If this is true, then we would not only have a right to our own
opinion, but we would also have a right for our opinion to be correct. Importantly, this would be true of every person’s opinion, even if these opinions contradict one
another. This is a much stronger and more controversial statement. For one thing,
just because we do not have a definitive way to settle a question does not mean that
there is not an objective fact of the matter about what the answer is. For instance,
many people think that ghosts are real, and many people think they aren’t. Both sides are surely entitled to hold the positions that they hold, but it would seem that ghosts
are either real or they aren’t. They can’t both exist and not exist, so someone must be
wrong here. Thus, even if we can’t definitively settle the matter, it seems entirely
likely, not just possible, that there is actually a correct answer.
 
Beyond this, however, we can also say that we do have some reason to think
there could eventually be accepted answers to philosophical questions as such. Recall
that sciences like physics, biology, and psychology have spun out of philosophy.
These topics used to be philosophical in nature and yet, they are now regarded as the kinds of things that are obviously not just matters of opinion. Not only have we seen
widespread agreement on the facts of these fields, but we also think that we have
good reason for this agreement. This should tell us that it is at least possible that the
same kind of consensus could emerge, equally justified, for other topics currently considered parts of philosophy.
 
Finally, even if we can never achieve this level of agreement on some of the
core questions of philosophy, and even if we are never able to rationally settle the
matter (whether or not others are rational enough to see it), we are still not
necessarily justified in saying that everyone’s views are equally rational. For example, it may be that we can’t decide, once and for all, the ultimate answer to the meaning
of life, but this doesn’t mean we can’t rule out a large number of wrong answers.
There is a fact of the matter about how many fish were swimming in Lake Erie at the
precise moment that George Washington awoke the morning before crossing the Potomac. Yet, the wide gulf that has passed between his time and our own prevents
us from ever knowing the answer to this question. However, we can still say that it
was more than none and less than 3.5 trillion (the estimated total number of fish in
 
9 the ocean). This is to say that some answers are clearly wrong, and some answers
make more sense than others. Even if this is the level of precision that we are
ultimately doomed to get when it comes to answering philosophical questions, the
project of narrowing down that range as much as possible still seems incredibly important. After all, these are the most fundamental and monumental questions of
human existence; they concern the nature of morality, the meaning of life, and the
existence of God. If we can know that some views on the question of whether we
have free will are definitely wrong, would that not be important to find out? The
same can be said for whether we have immortal souls, the external world exists, or whether we can ever be certain of anything.
 
Importantly, however, the claim that all of philosophy is just a matter of
opinion goes further than to say that all reasons and all beliefs are equally valid. The
implication lurking behind it is that we shouldn’t bother to care about our own reasons for what we believe about reality, truth, and morality. To say that something
is just a matter of opinion is often a rhetorical move designed to stop further
discussion of why we believe what we believe. It represents the end of inquiry.
Unfortunately, if we are right that not all philosophizing is equally reasonable, then this attitude will do little to inoculate us from the efforts of others to bend our
thinking in whatever ways they see fit. As we have already said, it is often our mind
changing us and not the other way around. Our reason compels us one way or the
other, and this fact is frequently exploited by those who stand to profit off our accepting a particular view. If we ought not worry our pretty little heads about
things like truth and justice, someone else will gladly step in and manage our heads
for us. To not care is to be subject to the philosophical skills of others. It is to let the
muscles of the mind grow weak and atrophy, and to permit those that care more to
move in and bully our brains. If we truly want to protect our right to believe what we see fit, if we are to all have our own opinions on these matters, then we must
guard ourselves to ensure that we are actually able to have an opinion that is truly our
own. This work requires evaluating our reasons for believing what we do.
 
It very well may be that there is no fact of the matter about one or a number of questions that we will discuss here, but in each case, that there is no fact of the
matter is a claim and, like all claims, it requires some justification if it is to be
believed. Until the matter is settled definitively, we will try to keep an open mind.
 
10
We will follow the arguments wherever they lead, and toward the most reasonable
view possible, even if that still leaves us with a range of possible answers. What we
should not do is uncritically assume that we can make no progress, and that we are
doomed to never be pulled from the mental spot which we have always inhabited. To not change is to not live, and to not change your mind is to not live a fully
human life. Our reasoning is the gift which gives us that, and we will try to use it.
 
The Stuff of Philosophy 
 
As mentioned above, philosophy doesn’t have one particular methodology
the way that science may have a ‘scientific method’. However, as we also saw,
philosophers tend to raise questions, offer their views (often as answers to those questions), and provide reasons for accepting or rejecting those views. We will now
survey a few important concepts that will help us in doing this.
 
First, philosophers tend to organize themselves and their work around
central questions. Accordingly, it is as much a contribution to the field to raise an enduring question as it is to answer one. We can call the questions of philosophy
problems. Particular problems will have particular names (e.g., the problem of universals, the problem of change, the problem of the one and the many). It is, then,
not uncommon to hear philosophers ask one another things like “what problem are you working on right now?”, answer things like “the problem of sandwiches (the
question of what is a sandwich)” or hear them say things like “I am raising a new
problem for the view that quesadillas are sandwiches'' (for example).
 
When it comes to expressing their own views, philosophers have historically
advocated for particular doctrines. A doctrine, here, is just a simple view about some particular thing, which may or may not be true, and which is being introduced by
that philosopher. To continue our example above, my (entirely hypothetical) view
that a quesadilla is a sandwich could be called the doctrine of the quesadilla. It is a
doctrine in the sense that it is a particular position being held and because it is a matter of some dispute. Admittedly, few philosophers today refer to their own
 
11 philosophical views as doctrines because it tends to sound overconfident and
dogmatic. Philosophers now like to think of themselves as more willing to change
their mind, whether or not this is true. Likewise, to refer to one’s own views as
doctrines seems to have an air of importance that most philosophers avoid. Nevertheless, it will help us to see the connections between thinkers throughout
history if we use consistent terms throughout the book.
 
If we zoom out a bit, we might look for a general rule that will apply to a
wide range of particular cases. We can call these rules principles. For instance, we
might ask someone defending the doctrine of the quesadilla what it is that actually makes the quesadilla a sandwich. If they answer that we should assume that anything
made with two distinct pieces of bread is a sandwich until proven otherwise, then we
can refer to that rule as the principle of sufficient bread.
 
Instead of offering a particular thesis or general rule, a philosopher might
also develop a model for thinking about a particular problem or phenomenon. We
can call these theories. For instance, one could argue that there are two fundamental categories of snacks (sweet and savory), and these categories can be further
distinguished by type (sour-sweet, creamy-sweet, cheesy-savory, and spicy-savory). On this view, a good snacking session is one in which all four types are represented in
equal proportion and in which the snacker cycles between each type throughout the
session. Because this is a broad model for thinking about snacking, we can call it the
theory of snacks. This may be sufficient as a name or, if later philosophers develop
their own theories of snacking, we might want to further specify which theory we’re talking about by calling it something like the fourfold theory of snacks, or so-and-so’s 
theory of snacks. You should also know that theories, in this sense, are also sometimes
referred to as ‘accounts’ (e.g., so-and-so’s account of snacks).
 
While the theories of philosophers differ from one another, they sometimes
avail themselves of being categorized together for the purposes of understanding. For
instance, I may have the view that a sandwich is just whatever McDonald’s says a
sandwich is, and you may think that something is a sandwich if and only if Burger
King considers it a sandwich. While these two accounts differ, they share in common the fact that they appeal to expert institutions like restaurants in determining what is
or isn’t a sandwich. This larger commonality is a position that we both share, and we
 
12 might call ourselves institutionalists about sandwiches or say that we both endorse a
form of institutionalism. Sometimes these positions reflect the fact that each of the
philosophers in question accepts the broad strokes of an earlier philosopher’s theory
but disagree on how to work out the details. As such, it is not uncommon for these positions to reflect the name of that common philosopher (e.g., Kantianism,
Pythagoreanism, etc.).
 
Finally, when a certain general outlook on a range of topics is shared by a
group of philosophers who were working in or around the same time and place, and
who might have studied under a common teacher, those philosophers form a school. These schools tend to take on the name of the location in which they originate (e.g.,
the Milesian school, the Eleatic school, the Pittsburgh school, etc.) or the name of
their originator (e.g., the Pythagorean school).
 
When it comes to providing reasons for or against a given claim (whether
that claim is a doctrine, principle, theory, or position), philosophers have a particular
affinity for arguments. An argument, in philosophy, is not like the argument you have with your uncle during the holidays (unless your uncle happens to be a
philosopher). Ordinary people use the word ‘argument’ to refer to two people disagreeing with one another. In philosophy, however, an argument is something
that one person could provide all on their own. In this case, it consists of a claim that
the arguer is making and some reason for accepting it. The claim of an argument is
called the ‘conclusion’. For instance, if I am trying to convince you that there is a fire
over there, the claim that there is a fire over there is the conclusion. In defense of this claim, I will build off of facts which I take to be accepted by or acceptable to the
both of us. We can call these facts premises. In this case, I might say that my two
premises are 1) where there is smoke, there is fire, and 2) there is smoke over there.
The two premises and the conclusion, together, form an argument. If this argument is especially important, we might give it its own name. In this case, we can call the
argument the argument from smoke. The argument can be stated thusly:
 
1.   Where there is smoke, there is fire.
2.   There is smoke over there.
3.   Therefore, there is a fire over there.
 
13
It is common for arguments to take certain forms, but they may vary in
length from one to very many premises. Finally, arguments are sometimes said to be
valid or sound. An argument is valid if its conclusion follows from its premises
(whether or not the conclusion itself or those premises are true). For instance, consider the following argument:
 
1.   All snails are birds.
2.   All birds are blue.
3.   Therefore, all snails are blue.
 
Here, 1 and 2 represent the premises and 3 represents the conclusion. This
argument is valid because its conclusion would be true if the premises were true.
Validity is a matter of the relationship between the premises and conclusion, not a
matter of any of them being true. This example is of a valid argument with all false premises and a false conclusion. However, there could also be valid arguments
featuring false premises and a true conclusion, a mixture of true and false premises
with a false conclusion, or premises which are all true and a true conclusion. This last
arrangement, a valid argument with all true premises and a true conclusion, is said to
be sound. An example of a sound argument might be the following:
 
1.   All crows are birds.
2.   All birds are animals.
3.   Therefore, all crows are animals.
 
Notice that this argument follows the same general form as the one above. Accordingly, it is valid for the same reasons that the first argument was valid. It
differs only in that its premises are actually true. Philosophers are quite good at
forming valid arguments, so if one wants to object to a particular argument, it is
often easier to deny the argument’s soundness by denying the truth of one of its
premises than it is to deny its validity. In this way, good arguments are valuable not only if they convince us of something we didn’t believe, or if they provide proof of
something we already know to be true, but also when they provide us with an
opportunity to clarify exactly where we disagree with one another. If we agree that
an argument is valid, your accepting it as sound and someone else’s rejecting it as unsound has revealed to us that you disagree about the truth of some crucial
 
14 premise(s). Thus, the debate can advance to proving or disproving the relevant
premise(s), and we can repeat this process until we come to some understanding.
This is often the way that philosophy proceeds.
 
Sometimes philosophers set up their arguments by having us imagine a
fanciful case. For instance, in her writing, the philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson 
asks us to imagine a runaway trolley coming towards us down the tracks.1 While we
are safely off to the side of the track, the trolley is on a trajectory to pass by us and hit
and kill five other people if we do nothing to stop it. However, we could stop it from
killing those five people by pulling a lever and sending it down another track. Unfortunately, this is the only option available to us and, more unfortunately, there
is another person on those tracks who is currently out of harm’s way. The choice
before us is, then, one of 1) letting the trolley kill five innocent people, or 2) choosing
to cause the death of one innocent person who would not have otherwise died. The
question of what we ought to do in this case is called the trolley problem.2 When an imaginary case is used as part of an argument like this, it is called a thought 
experiment. By contrast, philosophers sometimes bring up imaginary cases in order
to illustrate a point rather than in order to argue for it. These imagined cases are
called allegories, and they were quite popular among the ancient philosophers of Greece and China.
 
Finally, it is sometimes important to identify and define key concepts as we
have done above (e.g., arguments, problems, doctrines, etc.). These are ideas that
structure our thinking. Some of these are specifically proposed by an individual thinker and others are not attributable to one particular individual the way that
arguments, doctrines, and thought experiments are. In this case, where a doctrine
commits the philosopher to a particular claim about reality, a concept (in this sense)
might involve a philosopher picking out a phenomenon which may or may not actually exist, inventing a name for it, and defining it to suit their needs.
 
1 Judith Jarvis Thomson, ‘The Trolley Problem,” Yale Law Journal 94, no. 6 (1985): 1395-1415.  
2 While this version of the trolley problem originates with Thomson, Philippa Foot was actually the first philosopher to use a version of it (Foot 1967). Foot’s trolley problem asks us to imagine that we are the driver of the train and must decide whether to switch tracks or not.

Using This Text 
 
Throughout this book, we will mention and draw attention to the major
concepts, problems, doctrines, theories, positions, arguments, thought experiments,
and allegories from the history of philosophy. Some of these, along with particular
schools of thought, will be mentioned in bold italics. These are ‘key terms’ that you
should remember. You should also know that while the terminology used here roughly captures the ways in which philosophers today talk, like all other things in
philosophy, there is likely to be some disagreement about the meanings of these
terms and the names of particular contributions. Nevertheless, it will be helpful for
us to say what we mean by these terms, even if we can’t force everyone to follow our
lead. Important philosophers throughout history will also be mentioned in bold italics. You can find an index of all of these key terms and figures (and more) in the
“Index” chapter at the back of the book, but also summarized in the “Key Terms”
and “Philosophers” sections at the end of each chapter. The index will tell you the
places in which that term or person was mentioned, and the first, bold page number refers to the page on which that term was introduced or defined.
 
In addition, there is also a “Timeline” chapter at the back of the book which
will depict the lifetimes of philosophers we discuss, so that you can keep track of the development of philosophy across the world over time. This timeline features
columns for each region of the world. Philosophers are placed on the timeline at the
date of their birth (where it is known) and in the region in which they were born.
Notice that this puts, for instance, people like Milesian Greeks (born in modern day
Turkey) in the Middle East rather than in Europe. Finally, each chapter concludes with three short sections. Beyond the “Key Terms” and “Philosophers” sections
mentioned above, there is also a “Key Questions” section included at the end of each
chapter. If you are reading this text as part of a class, your instructor might ask you to
discuss these, or to write a written response to one or all of these questions as part of a class discussion, course assignment, or exam. Whether or not you are assigned these
questions (or even enrolled in a philosophy course), readers are encouraged to think
further about them after reading each chapter.

Before fully moving out of these introductory matters, it is important to
point one last thing out about the study of philosophy. This text attempts to provide
a foundational understanding of philosophy and its history. In many ways, it aims to
provide readers with an unbiased picture of what is basically agreed upon across philosophy. In turn, readers should be able to use it to help themselves navigate areas
where there is more controversy about what, for instance, a particular philosopher
thinks. However, all philosophizing and all historicizing happens from some
viewpoint. No one, including the textbook author, is free of prejudice about what is
important, what the right interpretation is, and which figures matter. The field also takes its shape from the way in which philosophy is introduced and how its history is
remembered, so a great deal hangs on these questions. Readers should keep in mind
that, for almost any given question in philosophy, various viewpoints will be on
offer. You are encouraged to critically interrogate this text along with the ideas and interpretations that it presents. This text is intended as the first word, to bring
readers into the conversations of philosophy, and not the last. Readers are also
invited and encouraged to continue their studies by engaging with the authors
presented here in their own words. In addition to the fact that these primary sources are the place at with the buck stops, wrestling with a thinker in their own words is a
rich and rewarding enterprise, and one of the great joys of a philosophical education.
Now, with all of that out of the way, we are ready to begin our journey through the
history of philosophy!

Indian Philosophy 
 
It’s difficult to say when and where the first philosopher lived. It is likely
that people have been doing philosophy in some way for as long as there have been
humans. After all, humans seem to be naturally interested in asking questions about the way the world is or ought to be, theorizing about these matters, and arguing for
those theories. Despite this, we might be able to at least identify the earliest known
philosophy and earliest known philosophers. Importantly, being first in this regard is
often a matter of happening to do it in a time and place where people have a penchant for writing down the things that people say, even when it isn’t obvious that
they matter in the present moment. One issue we find with many of the candidates
for being the first known philosopher is that it is not entirely clear whether the
figures in question are real people, fictional characters, or composites of several real people. This issue plagues scholarship in ancient philosophy around the world.
Despite these troubles, we may still be able to say a few things. For instance,
Zoroaster was at least among the earliest philosophers known to us, if not the first.
He was from what is modern day Iran, and might have lived as early as the 14th century B.C.E. He certainly put forward theories about metaphysics and ethics
(including that the human condition is one of having to choose between the
competing forces of goodness and falsity). However, whether we should count him
as a philosopher will depend on whether we think it matters that he 1) took himself
to be passing along teachings rather than coming up with them himself, and 2) whether we think it matters that philosophers argue for their theories rather than
preach them. Similar issues arise for other potential candidates who will be discussed
in later chapters.
 
However, if the quest for the first known philosopher is one of finding the earliest written record of people arguing about the nature of reality, then one
 
21 promising answer is to say that philosophy might have emerged into the written
record of the world in India, with what are now called ‘the Upanishads’. The earliest
of the Upanishads were possibly written as long ago as the 8th century B.C.E. This
means that the characters they depict would have lived at least two centuries prior to the first Greek philosophers. Even if these characters are composites (as was likely the
case for some Greek philosophers depicted in the various dialogues we read today),
then the authors of the Upanishads themselves are still engaged in philosophical
thought and argumentation. In either case, philosophy in India continued on after
the time of the Upanishads and all the way up to the current day. Accordingly, philosophy in India is a massive and varied topic. Despite this, some general
categories for thinking about the work of these philosophers do avail themselves,
even if they are not complete accountings of everything ever written in India. The
main division here is between the ‘orthodox schools’ of philosophy (those within Hinduism) and the ‘heterodox schools’ (those outside of it). What follows is a brief
summary of some major views, concerns, and figures of the central schools of both
camps.
 
The Orthodox Schools 
 
Which of the orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy came first is as tricky of a question as who the first known philosopher was. Many of the beliefs which
make up these schools are present as early as the Upanishads, but the schools
themselves are often not formalized as distinct from one another until much later.
Likewise, there are often not solid historical records of when the later figures who formalized these schools lived. However, textual evidence tells us that they interacted
with one another a great deal, which suggests that many may have emerged around
the same time. Without a clear timeline, we can start simply with the Vedanta 
school.
 
Orthodox philosophy in ancient India draws on earlier works called ‘the Vedas’. These are religious texts, written in Sanskrit. There are four Vedas (the
Rigveda, the Yajurveda, the Samaveda, and the Atharvaveda). Each of these, in
 
22 turn, is a combination of texts on mantras (the Samhitas), texts on rituals (the
Aranyakas), commentaries on rituals (the Brahmanas), and philosophy (the
Upanishads, as already mentioned). Post-vedic texts (those which come after the
Vedas) are usually written as collections of sutras, or short aphorisms expressing general principles or doctrines. These sutras are compiled together as unified works,
which draw on the Vedas (Upanishads or otherwise), and many of these texts serve as
the founding documents for the various schools of philosophy. In the case of the
Vedanta school, the founding text is the Brahma Sūtras, which is said to have been
written by Bādarāyaṇa. If all that is known about him is that he is the figure Bādarāyaṇa, then we can say very little about his life or when exactly he lived other
than that he is the author of the Brahma Sūtras. However, he is sometimes claimed
to be the same person as Vyasa, the compiler of the Vedas. If this is true, then much
more can be said about him. However, since much of what is attributed to Vyasa is mythological in nature, we will instead stick to what is known about Bādarāyaṇa,
which mostly just concerns his philosophical ideas.
 
One of the central claims of the Brahma Sūtras is that we should interpret
the Upanishads as attempts to describe the ultimate nature of reality and humans’ relationship to it. We will see that many ancient philosophers from all around the
world have grappled with this same question. Yet, what motivated the ancients to
search for an ultimate reality in the first place? Well, if we can talk about the universe
as a unified and singular thing which we can, in turn, say things about, then there must be some underlying unity behind it all that our thoughts and language point at.
We say that the universe is big and expanding, but when we look around to check
whether this is true, we don’t see a universe. Instead, we see a variety of individual
things (e.g., stars, planets, molecules, tables, chairs, and poodles). Accounting for this
unity and reconciling it with the enormous diversity of the particular things that
make up the universe, can be called the problem of the one and the many. The claim of the Brahma Sūtras is that the ultimate reality underlying the universe (as
revealed to us by the Upanishads) is Brahman. However, in order to understand how
Brahman constitutes an answer to the problem of the one and the many (and what Brahman is exactly), we must first provide a little background on Hindu belief in
general.
 
23 
At a basic level, Brahman is a placeholder concept which represents the
answer to the problem of the one and the many. Brahman is the underlying cause
and substance of the universe. It is 1) pure being, 2) pure consciousness, and 3) pure
bliss. The problem of coming to have knowledge of the universe is one of coming to eventually reach enlightenment, and to see the myriad of different things in the
world as they really are; as the one unified whole of Brahman. Against this
background picture of the nature of the universe and of the aim of human
knowledge, we can add the metaphysical structure of the human condition: the cycle
of reincarnation, or ‘saṃsāra’. In Hindu metaphysics, humans are born, live, die, and are reborn, relive, and redie, many times. We can call this view the ‘doctrine of
reincarnation’. However, if reality is, at bottom, all Brahman, then coming to have
perfect knowledge of the world is a matter of coming to the realization that all of the
particularities of these lives are, in some sense, illusions which distract us from the true nature of reality. One way of thinking about this is in terms of the ocean. When
we sit on the beach, we can point out and talk about distinct waves in the water. We
say that one crashes on the shore and then the other, and that this one is bigger than
that one. This language assumes that the waves are distinct. However, when we reflect, we can recognize that these are merely surface-level arrangements of one
continuous body of water. In this metaphor, these waves are us and the continuous
whole of the ocean is Brahman. Coming to perfect knowledge would be, in some
sense, to come to identify with the pure consciousness and bliss of the ocean and not the limited perspective of the wave. Accordingly, achieving enlightenment means
escaping from the cycle of saṃsāra and this freedom is known as ‘moksha’. Until we
achieve moksha, we work our way through the cycle of saṃsāra according to the
principle of karma. This rule tells us that the form that we take in this life is determined according to a moral law of cause and effect, and that good and bad
actions in our own lives will determine our position within the cycle in the next life.
The Vedanta school takes up this picture and attempts to work out the metaphysical
details. In what sense are the waves different from and the same as the ocean? In
what sense is the self (or ‘Ātman’) distinct from the Brahman which makes up the whole of the universe? We can call this question the ‘problem of Ātman-Brahman’.
 
While there are a great many positions within Vedanta, which all interpret
the relationship between Brahman and Ātman differently, three stand out as
 
24 especially important: Advaita (nondualism), Vishishtadvaita (qualified nondualism),
and Dvaita (dualism). Advaita is the first of these positions to develop historically.
While later scholars representing each of these three positions would claim the
support of earlier Upanishadic philosophers, Gauḍapāda is most often credited
with founding Advaita (though much credit should also be given to the later Adi 
Shankara for systematizing and defending the position). The Advaita solution to the problem of Ātman-Brahman is to assert that the two are fundamentally
indistinguishable in reality. To make sense of this relationship, Gauḍapāda raises an
analogy involving jars. There is only one space: limitless and undifferentiated. However, when we look at a jar, we can talk reasonably about the space in the jar as if
it is distinct from the rest of space. The jar contains some portion of space, but we
can still recognize that space itself is continuous and undifferentiated. The space in
the jar is no different in kind or nature than the space outside it. The same can be said of us. We are some contained, discrete part of Brahman, but Brahman itself
includes all of the portions which make it up, even those siloed off as different
Ātmans. This view denies that there is a distinct and separate ‘jiva’ (or soul) for each
person and that Brahman and Ātman are two fundamentally different kinds of things.
 
By contrast, Ramanuja’s Vishishtadvaita defends a form of ‘qualified
nondualism’. Ramanuja still maintains the truth of nondualism with regards
Ātman-Brahman but searches for an alternative metaphor which will allow us to better capture our intuition that the two are somehow mechanically distinct. Here,
Ramanuja thinks that Ātman is a qualified part of Brahman. A fitting analogy might
be the relationship between you and your foot. People say things like ‘I can’t feel my
foot’, which seems to indicate some distinctness between the part (your foot) and the
whole (you). Likewise, we can meaningfully talk about the differences between the various parts of the body. Yet, it also makes sense for someone to say something like
‘you’re hurting me’ when someone steps on their foot. The part and the whole are
nondual, but they are still distinct in some qualified sense.
 
Finally, Dvaita emerges last on the scene, with its founder Madhvāchārya. Dvaita, as a philosophical position, argues that Ātman and Brahman are actually
distinct in substance. One thing that motivates Madhvāchārya to depart this
radically from his predecessors is the principle of karma. Karma requires the ability to
 
25 attribute moral value to the actions and intentions of individuals and to produce
certain effects for those same individuals in future lives. If there are no distinct jivas,
then in what sense can there be any moral responsibility for individuals? After all, we
don’t blame our having kicked someone on our foot. Concerns like this are quite powerful given the background metaphysics and it was enough for a dualist school
to form around Madhvāchārya. Typically, Advaita and Vishishtadvaita philosophers
will respond by arguing their own cases on the basis of textual evidence from the
Vedas, and the debate rages on through history.
 
It is worth pointing out that not everyone is entirely satisfied with Brahman as an answer to the problem of the one and the many. For instance, the difficulty of
the question is made clear in one of the earliest recorded instances of philosophical
dialogue. This conversation, between the sage Yājñavalkya and his student Gārgī 
Vāchaknavī, comes to us from the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (also known as the Great Forest Upanishad). Here, Gārgī asks Yājñavalkya what serves as the underlying
principle of the world. Since the earth was often said to float on water, she is
naturally drawn to ask what underlies that water. She continues this line of
questioning; each time that he answers, she asks what underlies that thing, until he ultimately concludes that space itself is at the bottom of everything physical and,
beyond that, Brahman. When she asks what underlies Brahman, he simply tells her
that she might become unbalanced from this line of questioning and risks her head
exploding (a common threat in ancient Indian philosophy). Gārgī’s issue with Yājñavalkya’s solution to the problem of the one and the many is that it is susceptible
to an infinite regress. An infinite regress occurs when the answer to a given question
is unable to block re-raising the same question about that very answer. In this case,
we need some strong reason for why Brahman, as an answer to the problem of the
one and the many, should be regarded as a final answer. To this worry, Yājñavalkya has no answer (at least, not one that he can safely tell us).
 
Yājñavalkya’s wife Maitreyi, a philosopher in her own right, further
interrogates the implications of Brahman as an answer to the problem of the one and
the many. When Yājñavalkya comes to divide up his wealth and property among his wives so that he can dedicate his life to being a sage, Maitreyi is skeptical of the value
of that property. For one, if Brahman is the ultimate reality of everything, then the
passing of property from one person to another seems illusory. In reality, those two
 
26 people are the same (Brahman). Here, Yājñavalkya tells Maitreyi that property
exchanging hands is merely something that occurs in the mind of people rather than
in reality. The reality is that the property simply is, and we only think of it as being
mine or yours. If this is right, and enlightenment means coming to identify with Brahman, then ultimately, we would not concern ourselves with property changing
hands. Happiness, then, doesn’t lie in attaining or maintaining possession of
property, but in coming to knowledge and, ultimately, enlightenment. For this
reason, a better gift would not be to give Maitreyi property, but to give her the
knowledge that he possesses as a sage. This compels Maitreyi to conclude that the examined life is the good life. Thus, Maitreyi is able to draw ethical conclusions
about how we ought to live our lives on the basis of metaphysics.
 
The next orthodox school of Indian philosophy is the Mīmāṃsā school,
which is also sometimes known as Pūrva-Mīmāṃsā. Whereas Vedanta is most well-known for its debate over the metaphysics of Ātman-Brahman, Mīmāṃsā is as
known for its focus on epistemology. The school was founded by the scholar
Jaimini, who is said to have been a student of Bādarāyaṇa. Jaimini’s text, the
Mīmāṃsā Sūtra, advocates for a form of materialism. This is the philosophical position that material reality (that is, the stuff described by or reducible to the laws
of physics) is all that there is. Added onto this basic metaphysical picture is the
doctrine of Karma-mīmāṃsā, which says that it is strict adherence to ritual practice,
rather than enlightenment through understanding, which will lead to moksha. Accordingly, Mīmāṃsā philosophers spend a great deal of time and energy focused
on understanding how to best fulfill those rituals.3 These concerns push them away from metaphysics and towards epistemology.
 
The chief concern in Mīmāṃsā epistemology is in debating the goodness
and nature of five ‘pramāṇa’, or ways of knowing. First among these is perception. In this case, a perception leads to knowledge when it 1) directly engages with the
 
3 Scholars sometimes use the Greek term ‘orthopraxy’ (‘right-action’) to refer to religious beliefs, movements, or philosophies which are principally concerned with obeying rules of action. These can be contrasted with religions, and religious movements which are more concerned with adherents accepting and holding the right beliefs, which are referred to as ‘orthodoxy’ (‘right opinion’). Mīmāṃsā’s focus on ritual is, thus, a form of orthopraxy rather than orthodoxy.  
 
27 perceived object, 2) does not depend on words or language, 3) is unchanging, and 4)
is certain in a way that eliminates doubt. Second among the pramāṇa is inference.
Inferences allow us to make conclusions based on already known truths which entail
them. For instance, we can infer that there is a fire on the hillside because we already know that there is smoke, and that smoke is caused by fire. The third pramāṇa is
analogy or comparison. Here, a traveler to a new land might be told by someone who
has already visited that there are animals there which look like squirrels but actually
aren't. Because the traveler has this comparison in mind when they arrive, they are
right to think that the squirrel-like creatures they are seeing are the animals they were told about. Fourth, we have knowledge from circumstance. One example of this
might be a person leaving for a trip. Those that stay behind can know that the
traveler has returned because the traveler had indicated when they would return, and
that time has now passed. This is often regarded as a weaker form of knowledge than the others. Finally, there is the reliable testimony of expert sources. Since the rituals
are derived from the Vedas, it would make sense that the ritual focused Mīmāṃsā
would seek to ground those rituals in an appropriate source of knowledge, and what
source could be more reliable than the Vedas?
 
While all of these sources of knowledge are a matter of debate within
ancient Indian philosophy, and within Mīmāṃsā, there is also a sixth pramāṇa,
which is endorsed exclusively by the Bhaṭṭa sub-school of Mīmāṃsā. This way of
knowing was introduced by the philosopher Kumārila Bhaṭṭa, who would become a central figure within Mīmāṃsā. To the list above, Kumārila Bhaṭṭa adds
‘negative proof’. Whereas the other pramāṇa concern what can be learned about and
from facts concerning what is, negative proof is a matter of showing what is not the
case and what does not exist. For instance, we cannot directly perceive the poodle
that isn’t in the room with us, but we can still come to know that there is no poodle in the room by perceiving its absence. In this case, we don’t need to rely on expert
testimony or formal argument to know this, and direct perception, inferences from
circumstance, and analogy won’t help us either. On this basis, Kumārila accepts the
value of negative proof. This question, of how we can come to know that something doesn’t exist (such as the poodle in this room) will remain a thorny issue in
philosophy around the world and throughout history.
 
28 
Next is the Vaisheshika school. This school was founded by the philosopher 
Kaṇāda, who authored a text known as the Vaiśeṣika Sūtra. The Vaisheshika school is known for advocating for a form of atomism in response to the problem of
the one and the many. What is the ultimate reality underlying all things? Atomism answers that the world is made up, fundamentally, of tiny indivisible parts called
‘atoms’.4 Since the atoms are, by definition, indivisible, we can avoid the infinite
regress that plagued Yājñavalkya. There is nothing beneath the atoms because they
are necessarily the smallest things. Of course, we might think that modern science
tells us that atoms actually are divisible, and composed of electrons, neutrons, and protons. Indeed, those ‘subatomic’ particles are thought to be composed of even
smaller things! However, this would not deter the ancient atomists. Instead, they
would simply say that scientists were wrong to declare that they had found the
atoms. The real atoms are those that lie at the bottom of reality. This is, on the atomists’ account, by definition true.
 
On Kaṇāda’s atomistic theory, all matter is composed of atoms, of which
there are different kinds, and atoms can be neither created nor destroyed. These
atoms combine to produce the everyday objects we see around us by way of molecules. We can come to knowledge of these atoms (and the things that they make
up) by observing their motion. Indeed, this is the source of all knowledge since all
things are made of atoms. This view of epistemology is strikingly different from the
more varied approach undertaken by Mīmāṃsā, in which there are at least five ways of knowing. Instead of five pramāṇa, Vaisheshika offers only two. First, there are the
direct observations we have of the motion of atoms and their downstream physical
effects. This is equivalent to perception on the Mīmāṃsā account. Second, we have
inference, which allows us to conclude further knowledge on the basis of our
perceptions. This picture centers physics as the basis for all further inquiry. Since all things are made of atoms, we can come to have knowledge of Ātman by observing
the motions of the soul as well.
 
4 The word ‘atom’ comes from an ancient Greek word meaning ‘uncuttable’. This term was developed by the Presocratic Greek atomists, such as Leucippus and Democritus. More can be read about Presocratic Greek atomism in the “The Presocratics'' chapter.  
 
29 
Meanwhile, the Nyāya school was founded by Akṣapāda Gautama, who is attributed with authorship of the Nyāya Sūtras. Nyāya is well-known for having
contributed significantly to epistemology and formal logic, along with its debates
about the existence of God. Like many of the orthodox schools of Indian philosophy, Nyāya is not entirely distinct from the others due to the interactions
between thinkers across schools. In this case, the school’s epistemology further
develops the pramāṇas of Vaisheshika and Mīmāṃsā. Whereas Mīmāṃsā accepts five
pramāṇa and Vaisheshika accepts only two, Nyāya takes the middle position by
endorsing four: 1) perception, 2) inference, 3) comparison, and 4) expert testimony. Distinct to the Nyāya Sūtras is that, in addition to the five senses, Akṣapāda
Gautama adds the mind as an additional internal sense capable of perception.
 
Beyond this, however, the text also develops an account of good argument
forms; the first of its kind in Indian philosophy. Here, a good argument will feature five components: a hypothesis (which is to be proven), the reason, a general rule, an
application of the rule, and the conclusion (the hypothesis, now shown to be true).
Below is an example of a valid argument according to the Nyāya account:
 
1.   It’s wet outside.                                                   (hypothesis)
2.   Because it’s raining outside.                                    (reason)
3.   Wherever there is rain, it is wet.                                (general rule)
4. As seen in the fact that it rained here yesterday and was wet. (application) 
5.   Therefore, it’s wet outside.                                     (conclusion)
 
After Akṣapāda Gautama, the next most important figure from the Nyāya
school is Udayana. Writing much later than more ancient thinkers like Akṣapāda Gautama, Udayana is one of the most well-regarded philosophers in the Indian
philosophical tradition. Indeed, his reputation as a logician was such that, among the many other laudatory statements that come down about him, the later commentator
Vidyāraṇya tells us that Udayana “saw to the farthest shore of the ocean of logic”
(this, despite Vidyāraṇya’s own adherence to Advaita-Vedanta).5 These
developments in logic were put to use by Udayana in his attempt to unite the Nyāya
 
5 Vidyāraṇya is also sometimes referred to as Madhavāchārya, but he is referred to here as Vidyāraṇya in order to avoid confusion with the earlier Dvaita Vedanta thinker Madhvāchārya, who was discussed earlier in the chapter. 
 
30 school with Vaisheshika. However, our concern will be with Udayana’s other focus:
the problem of God’s existence. This is just the question of whether God exists or not and the various attempts to prove it one way or the other. Udayana’s
predecessor, Akṣapāda Gautama, had himself dealt with the issue of God’s existence but the issue passes quickly in the Nyāya Sūtras, which are more focused on debates
in logic and epistemology. In Udayana's own colorfully named Nyayakusmumanjali
(meaning A Handful of Flowers of Logic), he puts forward nine different arguments
for the existence of a creator God. These arguments are presented, in brief, below:
 
1.   The world is an effect, and all effects have a cause, therefore the
world must have a cause. That cause is God.
 
2.   Atoms are inactive. In order to form substances, atoms must
combine. In order to combine, atoms must move. Nothing moves
without intelligence and a source of motion. Since we perceive
substances, some intelligent source must have moved the inactive
atoms so as to combine them. This intelligent source is God.
 
3.   Something sustains the world. Something destroys the world.
Unintelligent laws of nature cannot do this. Therefore, some
intelligence must be behind the world’s being sustained. This
intelligence is God.
 
4.   Every word has meaning and represents an object. Something must
have caused the words to have their meaning. That cause is God.
 
5.   The Vedas are infallible. Human beings are fallible. Infallible Vedas
cannot have been written by fallible humans. Someone infallible
must have authored the infallible Vedas. That author is God.
 
6.   The infallible Vedas testify to the existence of God. Therefore, God
exists.
 
7.   Vedas deal in moral laws. Moral laws are divine. Divine injunctions
can only come from a divine creator. That divine creator is God.
 
8.   According to the laws of perception, only the number ‘one’ can be
directly perceived. All other numbers are inferences created by
consciousness. Humans are not capable of inferences at birth, this
is a capacity that develops. The development of human
 
31 
consciousness is evident in our ability with perfect numerical
conception. This ability to conceive numerically perfect concepts
must depend on something. That something is divine
consciousness. That divine consciousness is God.
 
9.   Everyone reaps the fruits of their own good and bad actions.
Something unseen must keep a balance sheet of right and wrong.
This balance sheet requires an intelligence to guide it. That
intelligence is God.
 
Many of these arguments assume a great deal (especially about the Vedas). However, many others bear a striking resemblance to their counterparts in
philosophy outside of India. Chief among these are the first, which is a form of the
‘cosmological argument’, and the seventh, which is a form of the ‘argument from
morality’. More will be said about these arguments later, but it is worth stressing the
diversity of proofs that Udayana gives. The places in which his work departs from other traditions are as interesting and valuable as the places in which there is
considerable convergence across traditions. Take, for instance, the fourth argument.
While the issue of how concepts come to refer to the things they refer to is an issue
that eventually gained considerable attention in the West, Udayana leverages this problem in order to solve another.
 
The fifth orthodox school of Indian philosophy is Sāṅkhya (sometimes
rendered Samkhya). The Sāṅkhya school is notable for, among other things, its
dualism (a position it shares with Dvaita Vedanta). While there were earlier Sāṅkhya texts which have been lost to us, the oldest surviving text from the school is
Sāṁkhyakārikā, authored by Iśvarakṛṣṇa. In the work, Iśvarakṛṣṇa defends a version of dualism which differs from Dvaita Vedanta. Where Vedanta dualism
divides the world into self and Brahman, Sāṅkhya draws this distinction between consciousness (or ‘puruṣa’) and matter (or ‘prakṛti’). The chief difference between
these two conceptualizations is that matter, on the Sāṅkhya model, is unconscious,
while Brahman is pure consciousness. This allows Sāṅkhya to maintain a form of
atheism (or disbelief in God or gods). Instead of creation being the result of the pure
consciousness of Brahman, it is the result of the mechanical coming together of puruṣa and prakṛti. This does not mean that all Sāṅkhya philosophers are atheists,
 
32 but that Sāṅkhya gave thinkers a path for accepting the larger framework of Hindu
metaphysics while denying the need for a creator god.
 
Sāṅkhya’s story about creation points us to another, related topic on which
the school has much to say: the problem of causation. Here, the question is simply
the matter of what it means for one thing to cause another. In what sense is x the cause of y? How does x cause y? For Sāṅkhya, causality is the natural (prakṛti)
equivalent of the kind of inferences we find in the domain of consciousness
(puruṣa). In inference, we can conclude something new on the basis of what we
already know. The new knowledge, the conclusion, is in some sense already contained within the reasons we use to conclude it. Arriving at the conclusion that
an ostrich is an animal is merely a matter of teasing out what is already lurking
behind the fact that ostriches are birds and birds are animals. In the same way then,
the effect must already be present in the cause, and causation is merely a matter of ‘bringing it out’. We can call this picture, in which the effect is already present within
the cause, the ‘doctrine of sat-kārya-vāda’. According to the Sāṅkhya school, we have
at least five reasons for adopting this account of causation:
 
1.   What is nonexistent cannot produce an effect.
 
2.   In order to produce something, we must have the required material
cause (e.g., there would be no glass jar without the glass).
 
3.   If this second point were not true, then anything could come from
anything.
 
4.   The creator of a thing produces only what they are capable of
(e.g., a sculptor doesn’t make paintings).
 
5.   The effect shares an underlying essence with its material cause
(e.g., a glass jar is still glass).
 
Given this underlying metaphysics, what can we say about Sāṅkhya’s
epistemology? Like Nyāya, Sāṅkhya strikes a middle position between Mīmāṃsā and
Vaisheshika, endorsing three pramāṇa: perception, inference, and reliable testimony.
Further, these three ways of knowing are hierarchical. We ought to form our beliefs based on perception, but when that isn’t possible, we can use inference. Likewise,
when inference isn’t available to us as a pramāṇa, we can then rely on testimony.
 
33 
Interestingly, this hierarchy places philosophy in a subordinate position. Since
philosophy doesn’t concern matters that can be directly perceived, it must be rooted
in inference. Yet, despite this lowered status, Sāṅkhya is still able to use philosophy in
order to make metaphysical conclusions about the nature of the universe and its relationship to moksha.
 
Once we have accepted that reality is divided up into consciousness and
matter, and that creation was the unification of these two things, we might wonder
why this happened in the first place. Why and how are nature and consciousness
related? According to Sāṅkhya, this bonding happened when the infinite perceiver (puruṣa) became enthralled with the infinite perceived (prakṛti). Due to
consciousness’ natural curiosity, our souls began to observe nature and, just like
when we watch a scary movie, we became so invested in particular characters that we
began to identify with them. When a character is surprised in a darkened hallway, we jump. When they are made sad, we cry. In the same way, extended observation (over
many lives) has led us to identify with the world of matter. This identification keeps
us trapped in the cycle of rebirth. We are not tied to the physical but spellbound by
it. Most importantly, this account allows us to avoid having to explain why and how the material interacts with the immaterial: they don’t, we are just closely watching
the physical. How, then, do we break the spell and escape the suffering associated
with life and death? Like most great performers, nature only performs for an
audience. The more that we look around and perceive the world, the more we can recognize the curtains and stage lights. Ultimately, we begin to distinguish prakṛti
from puruṣa and lose our sense of absorption in the story. Accordingly, prakṛti will
stop performing, having finished entertaining us, and we can escape the cycle of
saṃsāra. This story also allows us to explain the deep relationship between the search
for knowledge and moksha. We knew that the search for enlightenment would deliver us from the cycle of reincarnation, but now we have an answer for why
moksha is tied up in pursuing knowledge rather than other goods.
 
The final school of orthodox Indian philosophy is the Yoga school. The
school’s founder, Patañjali, was a contemporary of Iśvarakṛṣṇa, and their two schools are closely related. Indeed, Yoga takes on board Sāṅkhya’s dualism, dividing
the world into prakṛti and puruṣa, along with the same three pramāṇa: perception,
inference, and testimony. However, Patañjali’s project in his text, the Yoga Sutras, is
 
34 in working out the practical implications of this common metaphysical picture.
Where Sāṅkhya gave us an account of our goal, coming to distinguish between
prakṛti and puruṣa, Yoga offers us a path to get to this understanding. Namely, this
consists in getting consciousness to cease focusing on nature and focus only on itself and its true nature. One way of doing this might be self-denial. Eating chocolate chip
cookies tastes good. The pleasure we derive from it leads us to desire more. Desire,
however, is both earthly and particular. This means that it keeps us focused on the
material world; that is, the world of chocolate chip cookies. By denying ourselves
chocolate chip cookies, we resist the urge to stay enthralled by prakṛti. However, Patañjali does not go this far. Instead of advocating for a lifestyle of self-denial, which
was very common among the sages of ancient India, Patañjali tells us to merely
detach from the fruits of our actions. We can still eat cookies, as long as we do it in a
detached manner, treating it with the indifference that we might feel towards someone else eating chocolate chip cookies. It is not the action of eating them that is
the problem, but the desire itself. Avoiding desirous attachment prevents us from
slipping back into a focus on the material world and, by contrast, rituals and
recitations can do the positive work of focusing us away onto something other than our own desires. At bottom, this is a matter of reorienting oneself to identify with
their true self (puruṣa), not the self of the material world.
 
The issue of the self comes strongly into focus with the yoga practitioner
Sulabhā, and her debate with King Janaka in the Hindu epic, the Mahābhārata. It was commonly held in ancient India that everyone’s true self is male. This means
that, while we might live as women in some incarnations, ascending the cycle of
saṃsāra (and coming to a deeper and better understanding of our true nature)
means, in some sense, to strive to realize our more fundamental male form. In
addition to putting men in the dominant position, this belief also discouraged women from renouncing their positions and becoming sages (like Maitreyi did).
Women are simply too far removed from enlightenment for this to be worthwhile.
Instead, the belief was that they should focus on doing a good job of fulfilling their
duties in their current role so that they could have a shot at pursuing enlightenment in the next life. Thus, philosophy is held out above women by the male sages while
simultaneously representing a liberating renunciation of the gendered duties that
were imposed on women.
 
35 
In the Mahābhārata, we find Sulabhā living as a renunciate and wandering
sage. During her travels, she hears of King Janaka, who claims to have achieved
liberation from saṃsāra, even while maintaining his position as a king. Having
achieved enlightenment herself, Sulabhā is skeptical of Janaka’s claim. Accordingly, she challenges the King. He claims that his enlightenment is the product of coming
to knowledge and that he now has reached something like the detached form of
acting advocated for by Patañjali. This allows him to act as a king while still
remaining free of unenlightened desires. Further, Janaka is offended at being
challenged by a woman and demands to know who the sage is. Sulabhā responds by pointing out that bodies are material things. Since enlightenment involves coming to
distinguish prakṛti from puruṣa, if Janaka were truly enlightened, he would not
equate the question of who she is with facts about her body. The soul is distinct
from the body and is therefore not gendered. Likewise, the body itself can’t be said to be essentially gendered since sex differences only emerge in gestation. This means
that the body predates both sex and gender. In addition to disproving Janaka’s claim
to enlightenment, Sulabhā’s argument that the self is not gendered carries with it the
implication that women can pursue enlightenment. If knowledge of the true self does not mean coming to recognize its maleness, then women are just as capable of
reaching it as men. Thus, women have no reason to defer the life of a philosopher in
favor of fulfilling their traditionally gendered duties.

The Heterodox Schools 
 
It is important to make clear that the division between orthodox and heterodox schools is not entirely natural to the thinkers we are discussing. That is,
they often did not conceive of themselves as being either heterodox or orthodox, and
they did not confine themselves to debating only those other schools within their
respective camp. Just as the various orthodox schools influenced and built on one another, they also interacted with and were influenced by heterodox schools.
Likewise, it is just as important to point out that while the orthodox schools do share
in common that they regard the Vedas as authoritative, the heterodox schools are
only unified in the fact that they don’t do this. Accordingly, the details of their respective philosophical projects are even more varied than the already quite varied
orthodox schools. Where the orthodox schools all, in some sense, exist within the
framework of Hinduism, the heterodox schools are less unified in their relationship
 
37 with religion. Two of these schools (the Jain school and the Buddhist school) are tied
to their own respective religions. Meanwhile, others are completely materialist and
atheistic. Given the breadth and diversity of heterodox philosophy in Indian history,
we will focus on only five of the major schools here.
 
First of these schools is the Cārvāka school (sometimes referred to as the Lokāyata school). Cārvāka’s reputation is one of skepticism about ritual practice and
the supernatural. It is not surprising then that such a view would result in them
being considered heterodox by their Hindu counterparts. The school’s founder,
Bṛhaspati, originated the school with his text, the Bārhaspatya Sūtras, but it is, unfortunately, lost to us in the present day. Indeed, only scattered sutras survive
across all of the scholars from this school. This means that, in order to learn what the
school adhered to, we must engage with descriptions of their beliefs given to us by
rival schools in their attempts to refute Cārvāka. Of course, we might worry whether these accounts are accurate and fair, but by looking at commonalities in the school’s
description across many texts and authors of different perspectives, we can hopefully
say something about Cārvāka’s beliefs.
 
While they would have lived before the time of Bṛhaspati, and thus the founding of the school, the roots of Cārvāka can be found as far back as the
dialogues between Yājñavalkya and Maitreyi. Here, the two philosophers are
discussing the problem of life after death. This is just the question of what happens
to us upon our death. The traditional Hindu answer is that we are reincarnated
unless we achieve moksha. However, when they discuss the matter, Yājñavalkya tells Maitreyi that ‘after death there is no awareness.’ Maitreyi is puzzled by this given
their shared background of beliefs. Yet, despite Maitreyi’s worries, the Cārvāka
school elects to take up this account even if that comes at the expense of the entire
Hindu metaphysical framework, including the doctrine of reincarnation and the principle of karma. Their own position, in which awareness ceases at death, can be
called ‘annihilationism’. The most famous defender of which is the Cārvāka
philosopher Ajita Kesakambali.
 
According to rivals, Kesakambali argued that we, like all things, are made up of four natural elements which return to their natural place when we die. This is his
response to the mind-body problem. That is, the question of how the mental world
 
38 of the mind relates to the physical body. Since the mind is, on his account, a property
which emerges from the body, it also dissolves upon the dissolution of the body.
How, exactly, we should interpret the Cārvāka response to the mind-body problem
is a matter of some scholarly debate. Kesakambali’s ancient rivals attributed to him the doctrine of am-Jivam-tam-sariram-vada. This view holds that the mind and body
are identical; the mind just is the brain. However, some modern scholars believe it is
best described as a version of the philosophical position known as ‘emergentism’. On
this account, the mind is distinct from the physical body, but it emerges from it. This
is to say that the mind is greater than the sum of the physical parts which produce it. On emergentism, a fully worked out account of the sciences of the brain will not tell
us everything there is to know about the mind, even though the brain is the entire
root cause of the mind and its workings.
 
The second heterodox school is that founded by the philosopher
Makkhali Gosāla. Like Cārvāka, what we know about the Ājīvika school comes to us from descriptions from its rivals, as none of the primary sources survive. The
two schools also shared in common their atheism and skepticism about ritual. This
led Ājīvika philosophers to reject the doctrine of reincarnation, the principle of karma, and the quest for moksha. Without being able to appeal to Brahman as the
underlying principle of the universe, Ājīvika endorses a form of atomism similar to
that of the Vaisheshika school. However, it is their theorizing about free-will and
morality that makes them most well-known. Put simply, the problem of free-will is the question of whether we have it or not. In turn, this question depends on how we
define it. If, by free-will, we mean a delicious bowl of macaroni and cheese, then it is
a quite easy problem to solve; we simply look around us for the mac and cheese.
Likewise, philosophers throughout the ages have hotly debated how we ought to
define free-will for fear that any given definition will be biased towards one position on the problem or another. Despite their disagreements, most philosophers tend to
think of free-will as the capacity to make choices in our lives such that we can be held
morally responsible for them. Take, for example, a hurricane. It would seem quite
silly for someone to attempt to shame, sue, or punish a hurricane for having destroyed their house. Hurricanes just aren’t the right kind of thing for those
practices. The hurricane didn’t choose to destroy the house for reasons, it just
happened. The problem of free-will asks whether we are the right kinds of things for
 
39 practices like this and, if so, why we are different in this way from hurricanes. What
it would take for us to have free-will in this way is one of the biggest philosophical
questions throughout history and answers to it are numerous and varied.
 
The Ājīvika school stakes out a claim at one end of the spectrum of answers
to this problem by simply denying that we have free-will altogether. In brief, we are no different from hurricanes and, as such, it makes just as little sense to hold us
responsible for our actions. From the ancient sources, it would seem that their basis
for this belief was grounded in their atomism. If the universe is governed by
unchanging physical laws, and there is a fact of the matter about the way that atoms were arranged at the beginning of the universe, then there is a fact of the matter
about the way in which the movement of those atoms would play out. We often
think that our choices involve the ability to have done otherwise. You chose to order
the soup of the day instead of the salad but, if you could rewind the tape of the universe, you could in, some real sense, have ordered the salad. However, if we can’t
change the physical laws of the universe and we can’t change the initial position of
the atoms at its start, then how could you change the way in which the atoms of your
body play out? We are just physical bodies acting according to the laws of physics, against which we have no ability to do otherwise. This position can be called ‘causal
determinism’. Importantly, there are philosophers who believe that causal
determinism is true but still think we can be morally responsible. However, the
Ājīvika school holds that this means that we have no free-will. After all, how could we reasonably blame someone for what they did if they could not have done
otherwise? Ājīvika takes this position further by arguing that not only are we not
morally responsible, but also that there are no universal moral laws at all. This
position, called ‘moral nihilism’, means that we are never justified in holding others
morally responsible and that we have no real moral obligations. It should hardly be surprising that such a view was seen as outside the mainstream by the school’s
religious counterparts.
 
Next is the Ajñāna school, which is yet another skeptical heterodox
tradition in Indian philosophy. However, where Cārvāka’s skepticism focused on the problem of life after death and Ājīvika’s skepticism focused on morality and free-
will, Ajñāna philosophers focused their skeptical attention on the problem of 
knowledge. This is what we will call the question of whether knowledge is possible
 
40 at all, and under what conditions. Ajñāna’s skepticism on these matters is quite
strong; they argue that knowledge on all metaphysical and philosophical matters is
impossible. Perhaps appropriately, little is known about the origins of the school.
While we do know that it is quite old, we do not know who founded it or exactly how unified it was in ancient times. Nevertheless, we can at least say that one of its
strongest and most famous proponents is the philosopher Sañjaya Belatthiputra. He was a contemporary of Makkhali Gosāla (founder of the Ājīvika school) and
Ajita Kesakambali (central figure of the Cārvāka school), and they were all important
thinkers in the ‘Śramaṇa movement’. This was a loose collection of philosophers and their followers who emerged around the same time in the Greater Magadha region
(in the modern-day states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh) and sought to renounce
earthly possessions and lifestyles in favor of spiritual pursuits outside of traditional
Hindu customs. Belatthiputra spent this time wandering the countryside and advocating for the position known as agnosticism. ‘Agnosticism’, here, just means
the suspension of belief. That is, neither believing nor disbelieving in a given thesis.
Yet, while we could be agnostic about anything, the position is most strongly
associated with the suspension of belief or disbelief in God. However, Belatthiputra’s agnosticism is more global. He suspended belief and disbelief on all metaphysical
matters, including the problem of life after death, the problem of Ātman-Brahman,
the problem of the one and the many, and the mind-body problem.
 
Beyond believing that knowledge of the answers to these questions are out of reach of us humans, the Ajñāna school contends that answers to these questions
would not matter to humans. We can contrast this with the orthodox schools, which
saw knowledge (especially concerning the underlying metaphysics of the self and the
universe) as a path to liberation from the cycle of saṃsāra. If we can’t have this
knowledge, then enlightenment is also impossible and, with it, moksha. Interestingly, this means that Belatthiputra was in the position of teaching his
followers that he could not help them put an end to suffering (a fact that drove at
least a few to seek out alternative teachers). However, while knowledge of
metaphysics has no practical implication, Ajñāna holds that skepticism about that knowledge could and should inform how we live our lives. Namely, if no one can be
enlightened, then we should be skeptical of following those that claim to be. In its
time, this criticism was aimed mainly at the final two heterodox schools (the Jain and
 
41 
Buddhist schools), whose adherents sometimes claim that their founders are
omniscient authorities on philosophical matters.
 
This reputation, for attributing omniscience to the enlightened, is a fair one
when it comes to the Jain school. Just as the orthodox schools are rooted in Hindu
belief, Jain philosophy is rooted in the religion of Jainism. While the religion claims to extend far back into human history, the earliest philosopher who we have an
accurate record of from this tradition is Mahavira. Likewise, while the Jain religion
tells us much about his life, historians are limited to saying that he was from the
village of Kundalpur in the modern state of Bihar, and that he was likely an older member of the Śramaṇa movement. Like the rest of the figures we have already
discussed in the Śramaṇa movement, he sought out a distinct path to enlightenment,
outside the confines of traditional Hindu philosophical thought and religious
practice. In the end, Mahavira advocated for what are called the ‘three jewels’: 1) right vision, 2) right knowledge, and 3) right conduct. These three, together, mark
the path to liberation. As that suggests, Jainism falls closer to Hinduism than the
three skeptical schools we have already discussed. Jainism takes on board the doctrine
of reincarnation, the principle of karma, and the concepts of saṃsāra and moksha (though they are understood slightly differently in the Jain tradition).
 
Despite these commonalities, Jainism does depart from Hindu metaphysics
in some important ways. For instance, unlike Hinduism, with its dualist and non-
dualist interpretations, Jain philosophy is strongly dualist, dividing the world into
living beings (jivas) and insentient matter (ajiva). This distinction is not unfamiliar to orthodox Indian philosophy, as the Sāṅkhya school divided the world into
consciousness and unconscious matter. Rather, the difference is in the extent of the
agreement over this within Jain philosophy. Hinduism leaves open the possibility of
rival interpretations where Jainism is resolute in its dualism. More characteristic still, than its dualism, is Jain philosophy’s relativism. Rather than thinking that what is
true is universally true all of the time and in every case, relativism, as a philosophical
position, argues that a given statement can be true in some contexts and false in
another.
 
With regards to relativism, the Jain school endorses three doctrines. First of
these is the ‘doctrine of many-sidedness’. This view holds that reality itself exceeds
 
42 the individual viewpoint and can only be understood by bringing together a number
of different perspectives. The ‘allegory of the blind men and an elephant’ captures
this quite well. In this story, a group of blind men encounter an elephant that had
been brought to town. None of the men had previous experience with elephants and none were familiar with their physiology. One reaches out, touches the trunk, and
believes the animal to be like a snake. Another touches the ear and believes it to be
like a fan, and the third touches the leg and believes it to be like a tree trunk. While
no one person is entirely right, they are all right in describing their subjective
experience of the animal and, if they add up the totality of their respective experiences, they can describe the truth of the matter. This doctrine led the Jain
school to focus on synthesizing their rivals’ teachings rather than on refuting them.
 
The second tenet of Jain relativism is the doctrine of partial standpoints.
This view is closely related to the doctrine of many-sidedness, but they do differ. Where many-sidedness is concerned with the perspectives of multiple people, ‘partial
standpoints’ here refers to ways of looking at a given phenomenon. For instance, if
we examine a pair of scissors from a pragmatic viewpoint, the scissors are a thing that
cuts but might also be used as a paperweight. Likewise, the scissors are describable in different terms depending on whether we look at them entirely as they are in the
present moment (dull), as they are materially (a chunk of metal), or as they are
categorically (a human artifact). The doctrine of partial standpoints holds that it is a
mistake to take any one of these descriptions as exhausting the true nature of the thing. According to Jain philosophers, if anything can be said to be wrong about the
other schools, it is that they often limit themselves to one view for how to describe
the reality of the world. Accordingly, even when the Jain school argues against the
others, it is only on the grounds that they are all right rather than that the others are
strictly wrong.
 
Finally, there is the doctrine of conditioned predication. According to this
view, since reality is not exhausted by a single viewpoint or perspective, all claims to
knowledge are conditional. The mistake in this case would be to assert propositions
that claim to be universally true or universally false. We might think that a sentence like ‘the cat is on the mat’ is necessarily either true or false. We can then refer to a
formal logical system built on this idea as having ‘two values’: true and false. The
doctrine of conditional predication led the Jain school to develop a seven-valued
 
43 logic known as ‘Saptabhangivada’. This system contends that propositions can either
be 1) true, 2) false, or 3) unassertable. By combining these values, the system of
Saptabhangivada adds another four: 4) true-false, 5) true-unassertable, 6) false-
unassertable, and 7) true-false-unassertable. The working out of so-called ‘many-valued logics’ like this would not come fully to fruition in the Western tradition
until the early 20th century and remains an area of research in formal logic to this
day. We should take this as a testimony to the sophistication of ancient Jain formal
logic.
 
Finally, we have arrived at the last heterodox school and, as such, the last
school of ancient Indian philosophy that can be covered here. That is the Buddhist school. Like the Jain school, the Buddhist school is tied to its respective religion, and
we might regard that religion’s founder, Siddhārtha Gautama, as its first
philosopher. Gautama was a wandering Śramaṇa and a contemporary of many of the other figures we have discussed in Greater Magadha. He came to gather a significant
following and eventually earn the title of Buddha (or enlightened one). Much like
Mahavira, little can be confirmed about the circumstances and events of his life
beyond this, though religious adherents tell us much more. Also, much like Jainism, Buddhism adopts a significant amount of the Hindu metaphysical framework.
While Buddhism takes on board the doctrine of reincarnation (now rebirth), the
principle of karma, and the pursuit of liberation from the cycle of rebirth, many of
the concepts differ slightly. Chiefly, liberation from saṃsāra comes to be known by the Pali word ‘nibbāna’ (sometimes rendered as the Anglicized Sanskrit ‘nirvana’).
 
The core of the Buddha’s philosophy is summed up in what have come to
be known as the ‘four noble truths’. These are listed below:
 
1.   Suffering (dukkha) is an innate part of the cycle of saṃsāra.
2.   Suffering arises and is maintained due to desire (taṇhā).
3.   We can end our suffering by ending our desire.
4.   The eightfold path is the path to ending desire and suffering.
 
Given the account presented to us in the four noble truths, we might
reasonably wonder what the eightfold path consists of in. These are a set of eight
 
44 practices endorsed by the Buddha as leading to enlightenment and, ultimately,
nibbāna. They are presented below:
 
1.   Right view
2.   Right resolve
3.   Right speech
4.   Right conduct
5.   Right livelihood
6.   Right effort
7.   Right mindfulness






8.   Right awareness
 
Finally, the Buddha’s answer to the problem of personal identity is also
worth mentioning as a significant philosophical contribution. In this case, the problem of personal identity refers to the question of what makes a person now the
same person that they were before, and what makes them the same as the person they
will become. The Buddha’s solution is in some ways to deny the problem altogether.
That is, he declares that there is no persistent self over time. This can be called the
‘doctrine of anattā’ (or ‘no-self’). We might think that this thesis is absurd. After all, how could someone deny the self if there is no someone to deny it? However, the
view is less absurd than it may seem once we get clear about what it actually entails.
The Buddha does not deny that we have mental experiences (‘skandas’), but that
there is no underlying substance unifying these experiences. His argument, which we
can call the ‘argument from impermanence’, is this:
 
1.    The ‘skandas’ are fleeting.
2.   A self would be permanent.
3.   The skandas exhaust our mental lives.
4.   Therefore, there is no self.
 
Despite his profound influence over the philosophical school and religion
that bear his name, the Buddha is not the only philosopher within this tradition to
have made important philosophical contributions. Chief among those who came
after him are Nāgārjuna and Vasubandhu.
 
45 
Nāgārjuna, founder of the Mādhyamaka (or ‘middle way’) sub-school, is most well-known for his account of ‘emptiness’. Nāgārjuna argues that the Buddha’s
doctrine of anattā actually extends much further than the problem of personal
identity. It is not just that there is no underlying substance with regards to the self. Instead, there is no essential or unified substance underlying anything. Where
orthodox schools posited Brahman or atoms as the principle of the universe,
Nāgārjuna simply denies that there is one. Beyond its implications for the nature of
the universe, this account also tells us something about the way we should do
philosophy. We might be tempted to think that philosophy can tell us about the true nature of things. For instance, we might call on a philosopher to tell us what it means
to be a person or what it means to be moral. If there is no underlying essence to
things, then there is no one true answer to these questions. As such, where the Jain
school tells us that getting at the nature of things requires a variety of perspectives and viewpoints, Nāgārjuna is skeptical that any number of perspectives can get us at
some essence because essence itself is an illusion.
 
Finally, we have arrived at Vasubandhu. Like Nāgārjuna, he is
remembered as the founder of a sub-school within Buddhist philosophy. In this case, he was central to the establishment of the Yogācāra sub-school. Vasubandhu is
famous for, among other things, defending the doctrine of appearance only. On one
interpretation of Nāgārjuna’s theory of emptiness, everyday physical objects are
simply impermanent. They have a contingent existence that doesn’t permit of strong universal statements or claims about their underlying essences. Vasubandhu takes
this a step further by arguing that these everyday objects don’t actually have any
independent existence and are only products of perception. While there is
considerable debate over how we ought to interpret this doctrine, we can at least say
that it is commonly considered a form of idealism. This is the philosophical
position that reality is fundamentally mental rather than physical.6 Accordingly,
everyday objects like chairs and poodles have no independent existence outside of
 
6 Idealism will also famously be defended by the Early Modern philosophers George Berkeley and Gottfried Leibniz. It will also become dominant, in a slightly different form, in Germany as a result of the philosopher Immanuel Kant. More can be read about Berkeley in the “The Empiricists” chapter, Leibniz in the “The Rationalists” chapter, Kant in the “Immanuel Kant” chapter, and about post-Kantian German idealism in the “The Idealists” chapter.  
 
46 our perception of them. Contrast this with realism, or the position that mind-
independent objects exist. Realists can respond to idealists by asking how we can
have a perception of a poodle without there being some poodle we are perceiving.
However, the idealist will respond by arguing that the burden is on us to show that these objects exist. If we wanted to prove that a poodle exists, we would, after all, go
check and see. The challenge posed by the idealist is to find some way of
demonstrating the existence of these objects without appealing to their appearance
within sense perception or by relying on the testimony of others that we perceive and
who, in turn, perceived the objects in question.
 
Despite the immense diversity of the schools covered in this chapter, we
have so far only scratched the surface of the Indian philosophical tradition. A
complete accounting of the entire tradition (like all of the others discussed here)
would take much more time and space. However, many of the positions and problems we have so far discussed will remain persistent companions throughout
our exploration of philosophy in other locations and time periods. One such time
and place is ancient China. It is there that we turn to next.

Philosophy 
 
At the same time that philosophy was taking off in India, it also began to emerge across China as well. There, the Zhou dynasty had ruled for almost three
centuries, establishing a feudal society in which local states pledged fealty to the
Zhou rulers. The dynasty had acquired this position by overthrowing the older
Shang dynasty, which, itself, had been in power for around 600 years. Against this backdrop, of overthrowing a long-established government, the Zhou dynasty began
forming an answer to the problem of political authority. This is the question of where governments derive their authority from, or under what circumstances are
governments justly authorized to rule? The Zhou kings’ answer to this question was
that they had the Mandate of Heaven. In this case, governments have a divine right to rule insofar as they are just. Where is the evidence that Heaven approves of a given
ruler? It can be found in the fact that they have been and continue to be permitted to
rule. By the same token, another regime coming in and overthrowing them is simply
evidence that the first regime had become morally corrupt, lost the mandate, and that the new regime had gained it. However, after hundreds of years of rule, the
Zhou dynasty itself began to decline. Conflict was widespread, with vying factions
attempting to seize power over the others, each claiming to be just. This period was
known as the Spring and Autumn Period. After three hundred years of fighting, the Spring and Autumn Period gave way to a more stable period in which this conflict
was reduced to a dispute between a few major powers called the Warring States
Period. Given centuries of conflict, the question on most minds (whether they were
 
51 subjects or rulers) was one of how to put an end to all of the violence and achieve
some unity and stability within society. We can call this the problem of social cohesion. The search was on to find an answer that could bring peace, prosperity,
and calm to society, and, thus, secure the Mandate of Heaven. To this question, there was no shortage of attempted answers. The philosophies which emerged in this
period, known for its many philosophers and many philosophies, came to be known
as the ‘hundred schools of thought’. As the name would suggest, there were many.
We will cover a few of the most important figures here.
 
Confucianism 
 
Kongzi (sometimes rendered as the Latinized Confucius) was born into a
minor noble family in the feudal state of Lu (now the city of Qufu in the Shandong
province of China). While he would eventually earn the title Kongzi (meaning ‘Master Kong’), his birth name was Kong Qiu. His father, Kong He, was an aged Lu
military commander who died when Kongzi was three, leaving the child’s mother to
care for him in poverty. The young Qiu earned money sweeping the marketplace and
working odd governmental jobs through his early adulthood, including a job as a caretaker for livestock. Garnering a reputation as a teacher of some repute, he
eventually worked his way up through the ranks of Lu bureaucracy until achieving a
position as the Minister of Crime. From here, he was involved in a series of disputes
between aristocratic families, in which he attempted to seek a way to consolidate his
influence and institute various political reforms. His efforts failed and he underwent a self-imposed exile (perhaps disapproving of the moral character of the Duke of Lu).
In this exile, he traveled throughout the various states of northeastern and central
China, teaching his own answers to the problem of social cohesion and on other
issues related to statecraft, but never seeing them enacted. Eventually, in his old age, he was invited to return to Lu. His position there offered him little influence, but he
did take on a number of disciples who would carry his teachings with them after he
passed away of natural causes, and these teachings have come to be called
‘Confucianism’.
 
52
While Kongzi failed to achieve much influence over matters of state in his
own lifetime, his influence on intellectual life in China and, as such, the world, is
difficult to overstate. Given his philosophy’s eventual success, much of his way of
thinking (especially when it concerns matters of ethics and the state) is cooked into the assumptions of Chinese society, even if adherents and proponents aren’t always
consciously aware that he is the originator of such ideas. Importantly, Kongzi would
not consider himself the originator of those ideas; he liked to believe that he was
simply passing on the traditional wisdom of the ancient Zhou dynasty. While the
Zhou had managed to remain in power until very recently, their considerable decline over these centuries was evidence for Kongzi that they had drifted away from the
spiritual and ethical traditions which enabled their growth and stability. This hints at
his own answer to the problem of social cohesion. Kongzi was skeptical that laws
were enough to instill good social behavior. Laws are enforced by punishment, but punishment only motivates people to avoid punishment, not to be good, and we
need good people in order to make a just and stable society. If you punish a child
when they confess to having done wrong, it is just as likely that they will learn not to
confess as it is that they will learn not to do wrong. Avoiding punishment, then, becomes a cat and mouse game between the offender and the authorities. The only
thing that will motivate people to do the right thing when they can get away with
doing the wrong thing is shame. When people feel shame, they internalize their sense
of duty and their own sense of guilt about having failed to fulfill it. Kongzi, being a careful student of human psychology, recognized that a sense of shame could be
brought about through tradition, reverence for the elders, and reverence for their old
ways of doing things. Rituals, for Kongzi, shape our emotions, and emotions shape
our behavior. By adhering to carefully thought-out rituals, we cultivate our moral emotions and, as such, ourselves. We can call Kongzi’s picture, posited as a solution
to the problem of social cohesion, his theory of ritual psychology.
 
What, then, is good behavior for Kongzi? Principally, it is a matter of
personal exemplification. This reflects his skepticism about explicit rules. Just as he
has a preference for individual self-cultivation over laws in matters of the state, the same applies when it comes to governing oneself. The view that morality is a matter
of self-cultivation and character, rather than consequences or rule-following, is called
 
53
virtue ethics.7 How, in any particular case, one should embody virtue is a kind of practical knowledge that sages learn through experience. If morality were merely a matter of following a set of rules, then any child capable of reading would be just as
wise on matters of morality as someone who has lived a long life of hard-earned wisdom. As we have seen, this notion runs counter to Kongzi’s reverence for the
authority that age provides. For Kongzi, recognizing and respecting the wisdom of
our elders (like parents and ancestors) is called ‘xiao’, or filial piety, and it is the
root of benevolence.
 
This doctrine isn’t merely a matter of moral psychology; it is supported by an underlying metaphysical structure. Kongzi brought on board some basic ideas
about the nature of the universe from the Shang dynasty, which will be helpful in
understanding his reasoning. For instance, he takes on board the cosmological
picture in which the universe can be divided into two realms: the earth (‘di’) and heaven (‘tian’). This division is not hard and fast though, and the veil between them
is permeable. Communication between the two realms is possible. The people of the
material world can perform rituals in order to communicate with and be granted the
guidance and support of their ancestors. How does this happen? In a moment of great need, a person may perform a ritual; they are reaching out. In response, the
calm and assurance they feel is the imparting of wisdom. Their mind is attuned to
what is important to think about and what emotional response to it is appropriate.
This explains the underlying metaphysics of how participation in rituals enables us to achieve virtue. In performing the rituals, you are allowing the wisdom of the
ancients to guide you.  Likewise, Kongzi argued that tian was ordered and perfect,
while di required human intervention in order to maintain order (that is, to realize
the will of tian on earth). It makes sense then that if rulers want the approval of
heaven, they should draw the wisdom and order of heaven into the world through adherence to filial piety and ritual.
 
This brings us to the final point about Kongzi’s answer to the problem of
social cohesion. The example we used above, of a child being punished upon
confessing to having done wrong, differs from Kongzi’s account of governance in an

54 important way. On that analogy, the question is one of how we deal with
misbehaving children. Kongzi did not think that social cohesion was solved by rulers
instilling shame to serve their own ends. His doctrine was not one for rulers to
simply use to control the masses. Rather, rulers are subject to the same code of filial piety as the rest of us. By respecting the old ways of the ancestors, rulers take on the
wisdom of heaven and, under its observation, feel a sense of enthusiasm toward
embodying virtue and a shame towards failing to. When rulers exercise virtue, their
subjects feel enthused to do so themselves. This forms a chain down through the
hierarchy of society in which no individual member wants to be the one to drop the ball. Kongzi calls each person fulfilling their social role in accordance with this
model, the rectification of names, and it is central to his philosophy. Each social
role (e.g., ruler, governor, teacher, student, parent, or child) comes with a certain set
of special obligations which provide us with an ideal to strive towards, and everyone must do their part in trying to realize that ideal. When this happens, society begins to
feel like a team and every part of the whole begins to pull in the same direction.
Importantly, however, the rectification of names starts at the top, with it being
necessary that rulers cultivate their virtue and serve as moral exemplars.
 
Mengzi (born Meng Ke, and sometimes rendered with the Latinized Mencius) is sometimes described as the ‘second sage’ of Confucianism. He was born
in the state of Zou, less than twenty miles south of Kongzi’s birthplace in modern
Shandong province. By all accounts, his mother was deeply invested in his upbringing and his education, and she would later be held up as an exemplar of
motherhood in China. She is said not to have tolerated truancy and to have moved
three separate times throughout his childhood in order to find an environment that
would not enable his wayward behavior. Having arrived on the scene about one
hundred years after the death of Kongzi, Mengzi did not have the opportunity to study with him, but is said to have studied under his grandson, Zisi. Like Kongzi
though, Mengzi spent much of his life traveling between the various warring states of
the period, offering his teaching and counsel and, also like Kongzi, failed to exercise
much influence during his own life. After forty years of travel and teaching, and seven years as a scholar at the Jixia Academy in the state of Qi, Mengzi took a three-
year absence from his work to mourn the death of his mother (an expression of his
filial piety). He died in old age, not long after his retirement, at home in Zou.
 
55
Mengzi’s philosophical project is, principally, one of filling in the details of
the account he inherited from Kongzi. Mengzi accepts the story of self-cultivation as
paramount in morality, and virtue as the goods of that cultivation. However, he goes
further in telling us something about the virtues themselves. Mengzi posits four
innate dispositions at the heart of morality: propriety, righteousness, wisdom, and benevolence. Kongzi has already established that ritual was the key to self-cultivation
and that this was possible through its ability to instill the right moral emotions.
Mengzi provides us with an account of which emotions relate to which virtues.
Respect is the emotion of propriety, disdain of righteousness, approval and disapproval of wisdom, and compassion of benevolence. Benevolence (or ‘ren’), for
Mengzi, is chief among these, and it is characterized as properly partial. While he
does hold up compassion for strangers and animals as examples of benevolence, he
also believes we ought to have more concern for our own families and teachers. This makes sense, given Kongzi’s teachings about the rectification of names. How are we
supposed to properly embody the role of ‘mother’ if we care just as much for all
children as we do our own. In such a case, the title seems to lose all meaning and, as
such, the role seems to fall away.
 
The four innate dispositions set up Mengzi’s most famous contribution: his
theory of human nature. As their name suggests, these four dispositions are innate in
all of us. This means that we are all capable of becoming virtuous. Perhaps taking a
page from his mother, Mengzi contends that these virtues are like seeds, and all it takes for them to grow is the right environment and a little cultivation. In order to
argue this point, he appeals to the child at the well. In this thought experiment, we are supposed to imagine someone walking past a well and seeing a small child playing
around the ledge of it. The human response to such a situation would be to run over
and save the child from falling in. Whether we would get a reward from the child’s parents is an afterthought. The seed of compassion is already within us, and we must
merely keep its fire burning. This account puts a distinctly positive spin on the more
neutral picture we find in Kongzi. We already knew that virtue required cultivation,
and that might lead us to think that it is something that needed to be instilled into humans from the outside. Mengzi’s argument is that just because cultivation is
necessary to fully realize something (in this case, virtue), that doesn’t rule out the
 
56 thing already being present in some form. Indeed, this is something we already know
from gardening.
 
The last of the three major figures of Confucianism who emerged during
this period is Xunzi. Born Xun Kuang, little is known about his family or early life,
but we do know that he hailed from the landlocked far northern state of Zhao (in modern China’s Shanxi province). Likewise, we know that he spent his adult life the
way that most philosophers of the time did, traveling around the various states of
China teaching and offering advice to kings and bureaucrats. After a failed attempt
to convert the king of the state of Qin to Confucianism and a five-year stint debating military strategy in his home state of Zhao, he took up a position as the Magistrate of
Lanling (a town in the southern state of Chu). It is there that he eventually retired
and died in his nineties.
 
Xunzi is, perhaps, most famous for taking a very different line from his
predecessor Mengzi, when it comes to human nature. Where Mengzi had thought
that humans had innate virtues, the seeds of which only required continuous
cultivation, Xunzi thought that virtues were imposed on humans from the outside.
If a Confucian wanted to know how to cultivate virtue, Mengzi could tell them to look within themselves, at their first instinct (as we saw with the child at the well),
and that they need only guard themselves from being led astray by the world.
Meanwhile, in Xunzi’s “Human Nature is Evil,” he argues that we should look not
within ourselves, but to the past. The problem, for Xunzi, is a matter of priority in
interpreting Kongzi’s theory of ritual psychology. Kongzi told us that rituals were good because they orient us towards virtue. By participating in ritual, we practice
having the right emotional response to the right situation, come to value the things
that are valuable, come to recognize the things that are relevant and, in doing so,
order ourselves. On Mengzi’s interpretation, our rituals can do this job if they just preserve what is already in place. However, this means that any ritual which works to
preserve our instinctual virtue could work just as well as any other. Xunzi returns to
the underlying metaphysics Kongzi passes down from the early Zhou dynasty. The
rituals work to cultivate our character because they are wisdom from heaven passed down through the ages, not just because they are rituals. For this reason, the rituals of
our ancestors are better than arbitrary rituals we could invent. If this is right, then
the goodness and order that rituals provide is sourced from heaven, not from seeds
 
57 which are innate within us. Virtue is not a matter of cultivating our seeds but of
knowing the roadmap that heaven provides us, which Xunzi called the ‘way of
human beings’ (‘zhi dao’).
 
Another thing that Xunzi was famous for was his defense of the value of
music. A common thought might be that music (and perhaps all art) is valuable for the pleasure it gives individuals who engage with it. Accordingly, good music is just
whatever makes us happy to listen to and bad music is the kind that makes us
unhappy. This position is called ‘aesthetic hedonism’. Xunzi, by contrast, believed
that music could help to cultivate virtue and, in doing so, work to address the problem of social cohesion. In the same way that rituals are valuable for our
character because they orient us to have the proper emotional responses to the
morally relevant facts of life, music also has this ability. Xunzi argues that when
music has a calming effect, it makes people harmonious, and when music has a stern and serious sound, it makes people ordered. A harmonious and ordered society is a
strong one and is unlikely to be invaded. In the same way, when people of different
social positions listen to music together, they are joined in reverence, united despite
their different stations in life, and oriented towards what is good and valuable. Thus, on Xunzi’s account, music is valuable not for the pleasure it brings, but due to its
role in our moral development. Of course, as we might expect given Xunzi’s
Confucianism, music only works in this way when it is used as part of a meaningful
ritual. However, notice that this means that music is not valuable for its own sake but, rather, for its role in fulfilling some function; namely, helping our moral
development and contributing to general social cohesion. In contrast to aesthetic
hedonism, this is a kind aesthetic instrumentalism. While instrumentalists agree
that art is valuable exclusively or primarily due to its function, they often disagree
about what function it should play in our society or for the individual.
 
Mohism 
 
Mo Di, who would come to be known as Mozi, was born in Kongzi’s home state of Lu (in the modern city of Tengzhou) and lived between the time of Kongzi
 
58 and Mengzi. He is thought to have been part of a lower social caste than many of the
other philosophers we have so far mentioned. This fact, along with his background
as a carpenter and reputation for developing defensive measures for use in siege
warfare, would both come to seemingly influence his philosophical outlook. Like many of the other philosophers of the period, he traveled around the country,
visiting and counseling various states, and offering his teaching to students. In this
regard, his primary concern appears to have been his many attempts to talk leaders
out of invading their neighbors, typically consulting one state on how to defend
themselves and then telling their enemies that it wasn’t worth invading on account of these fortifications. However, it is not enough to just say that these defenses were
effective. In one illustrative story, Mozi engaged in a series of wargames with the
chief military strategist of the state of Chu. After defeating this strategist in all nine
games, he was threatened with death and expelled from the state, but this success convinced the leaders of Chu that they ought not invade the state of Song, who
Mozi had advised, and warfare was therefore avoided. These examples illustrate
Mozi’s commitment to careful reasoning and encouraging people to care for the
welfare of all people (and not just the interests of themselves and their clan) would become hallmarks of the position which takes its name from him: Mohism.
 
It is sometimes claimed that Mozi was the first philosopher in China to
systematically argue for his views rather than merely advocate for them. Whether or
not this is true, Mozi did contribute a great deal to philosophy. Chief among these contributions is the fact that Mozi is the first known philosopher in the world to
defend a form of consequentialism.8 This is the position we should judge the morality of an action, belief, policy, or position on the basis of the degree to which they or it bring(s) about positive outcomes. In this case, Mozi advocates for a view in
which we ought to focus on how our actions benefit the state. We can call this position ‘state consequentialism’. How do we measure the consequences of our
actions and policies for the state? Mozi posits three intrinsic good outcomes: 1)
order, 2) material wealth, and 3) population growth. Good individuals, actions,
rulers, and policies are those that increase these things. This state consequentialism is Mohism’s answer to the problem of social cohesion; policies that bring about order,
 
8 Consequentialism will be discussed further in the “Utilitarianism” chapter. 
 
59 material wealth, and large populations will lead to happy and secure societies. We can
contrast this answer with that given by Confucianism. Kongzi and his disciples argue
that leaders should cultivate themselves as moral exemplars, and that social unity is
achieved when those leaders are virtuous. Mozi is not as directly concerned with the inner mental and emotional lives of leaders and is far more focused on the results of
their policies. If being a moral exemplar does bring order and wealth to a society,
then Mozi would agree that it is good for that reason. Indeed, he ultimately argues
that the right intentions matter for a ruler. However, the society is not good because
the ruler is good, the society is good because it has policies which produce the best outcomes, and it just happens that a certain positive effect produces the right kind of
policy. In this way, Mohism is a radical departure from Confucianism, in which the
goodness of a ritual is tied to its connection to our ancestors and traditions.
 
Another contrast between Mohism and Confucianism can be found in their treatment of special obligations. These are obligations that one person has that
others don’t, which they have on the basis of their filling a special social role. For
instance, a mother may have obligations to her own child that she does not have to
every child. The obligations between an individual child and a mother are different from those between strangers, and different from those between a doctor and a
patient. Confucianism endorses a view that we have a myriad of special obligations.
Given what Kongzi said about the rectification of names, it is important that a father
should act like a father and that a ruler should act like a ruler. In this case, we recognize that acting like a father means caring for your children; that is the special
obligation of fathers. This vision is partial. Parents should be partial to their children;
citizens should be partial to their government. Mozi argues for an impartial kind of
moral concern called ‘inclusive care’ (‘jian ai’). On his view, people ought to care for
each other equally, regardless of which family, clan, or state they are a part of. This makes sense given his consequentialist leanings. When it comes to maximizing the
good outcomes for society, we must regard everyone’s interests equally. In a world in
which kings pass down rule to their children, and in which corruption and self-
dealing is rampant, a genuine commitment to impartiality is a very progressive commitment to public service. This is central to Mozi’s philosophy.
 
With these concepts in mind, we now have the tools to understand Mozi’s
argument against Confucianism. Confucianism appeals to the rituals of the past as a
 
60 guide for how rulers ought to govern in our time. However, Mozi points out that
people did many things in the past, some of which we would consider overly
elaborate and expensive uses of public resources or downright immoral. Clearly some
traditions are worth preserving and others aren’t. In continuing on the traditions of the past we curate it. We decide which traditions are worth considering and which
aren’t. This means that we need some objective criteria by which we can evaluate
policy, since appealing to it happening in the past doesn’t settle the matter. To
illustrate this, he presents us with the allegory of the carpenter (which he is well-
qualified to comment on, given his work in carpentry). Just as a carpenter uses a set square as a tool in order to evaluate their own work and the work of others, we can
use special tools to evaluate the work of people and rulers. Mozi calls these evaluative
tools models (‘fa’). Notice something about how the set square works, however. A
carpenter makes a straight right angle by tracing the outline of the set square, which they know to be the angle they want. The fa function the same way. They are
examples of good beliefs, rules, and actions which we can use as guides for our own
actions, rules, and beliefs. A ruler may look to historical cases in order to come to a
conclusion about how to act in the present, but the goodness of that historical action isn’t in virtue of it being historical. Rather, we know it to be good for further
reasons, which is why we use it to measure now. This seems to raise a further
question about how we could evaluate our models of action and belief. This means
we must turn to epistemology.
 
With regards to the question of when we are justified in believing
something, Mozi gives three criteria: 1) it should conform to our observations of the
world, 2) it should conform to what was known in history, and 3) it should produce
good results. We can call these the ‘three criteria of correctness’. You can see all three
of these criteria in play in Mozi’s treatment of the existence of ghosts. With regards to the first criteria, plenty of people report observing ghosts in the world. Likewise,
the sage-kings of the past believed in ghosts and acted accordingly. Finally, the belief
in ghosts plays an important social function. People tend to behave better when they
think that ghosts will reward or punish them for their behavior. These three facts, taken together, provide Mozi with reason to accept the existence of ghosts and, while
the existence of ghosts doesn’t linger on as an important philosophical topic, Mozi’s
criteria are an important advance in thinking about rationality and the justification
 
61 of our beliefs. Importantly, the third criteria (that a belief ought to produce good
results) makes Mohist epistemology a form of pragmatism. This is the philosophical position that we can measure the truth of our beliefs and theories by
measuring their practical effectiveness. Pragmatism remains a popular view within epistemology to this day.
 
Legalism 
 
While it's possible that there were, at one point, a few older texts, the oldest
surviving work of legalism is credited to Shang Yang (given name Gongsun Yang),
who was born to a concubine to the ruling family of the state of Wey (in the modern
northeastern Henan province). He is thought to have been a younger contemporary of Mengzi and to have died prior to the birth of Xunzi. He was educated in law and
worked from a young age in a low-level position under the Prime Minister of the
nearby state of Wei. He was eventually convinced to leave this post in order to
become chief advisor for the Duke of Qin. In this role, he pursued a number of reforms which strengthened the state to the point that they eventually felt confident
enough to lead an attack on Wei. Because of his role in leading this attack, he was
granted his own fiefdom of fifteen cities in Shang and became known as Shang Yang.
That his title was the lord of Shang (‘Shang Yang’) and not Master Yang (‘Yangzi’) should give us some indication that he was better known in his time for his hands-on
approach than for his philosophizing. As a ruler, Yang was known for rewarding
those who did well and punishing those who didn’t, regardless of their status as
nobles or peasants. This model, in which governments are ruled by those who
demonstrate great ability, can be called meritocracy. Yang’s tendency to elevate high-performing peasants and punish low-performing nobles did not garner him
much support among the Qin nobility. While he enjoyed the support of the duke,
the tides quickly shifted after his death. Qin’s new ruler, King Huiwen, who was angered by having been punished like a commoner, ordered the death of Yang and
his family. While Yang tried to avoid this punishment by going into hiding, his
family was executed and he, himself, was eventually killed by being tied to five
 
62 separate chariots and being pulled apart as they were driven into different directions.
Despite his anger, King Huiwen could not deny the success of Yang’s reforms, and
they were left in place, eventually allowing the Qin to win the conflict of the period.
This success carried over from the Qin dynasty to the Han dynasty, whose Emperor Wu Di followed many of the doctrines of legalism while, at the same time,
promoting Confucianism as the official state ideology.
 
Given Shang Yang’s success during and after his lifetime, we might want to
know what legalism consists in. At its most basic, legalism is the position that laws,
not rituals, form the basis of social cohesion. Whereas Confucianism wants virtuous leaders, motivated by respect for tradition, and Mohism wants compassionate
leaders, motivated by inclusive care, legalism makes no commitments about such
moralizing. Rulers come and go, and good rulers are few and far between. Instead of
depending on rulers and ministers who are exceptional and who go above and beyond, legalism aims to make society resilient by making and enforcing strong laws
which can be carried out by anyone. What kinds of laws? Typically, legalism
advocates for harsh punishments for offenders which serve as a motivational stick,
and which are contrasted with the carrot of peasant promotion. A real competition between all of the state’s people, along with consistency in punishment, will elevate
those that perform their task well. While legalism is progressive in terms of its social
mobility, it is cynical when it comes to people’s motivations. The Confucian reliance
on and cherishing of rulers of virtue strike the legalists like Shang Yang as naive. In the end, people tend to do what is in their self-interest and what is in the interest of
their state; their moralizing is merely a rationalization after the fact.
 
However, it isn’t just that this view better reflects the reality of human
nature for the legalists, it is also better than the alternatives. First, we can’t really ever
know the models of the past. Confucianism tells us that the great leaders of the past had respect for heaven and the ancestors in their hearts when they made policies, but
how can we know the inner lives of people who lived long ago? In this way, Shang
Yang argues that the fa of Confucianism is unfounded. Second, while Mohism
recognizes the problems with basing policy off of tradition, it is inflexible. Mohism’s three criteria and the requirement of inclusive care are supposed to apply throughout
history and across contexts. By contrast, legalism argues that context is relevant to
what models will work; certain fa apply only in certain contexts. The result of this is
 
63 that we should be pluralists about models, adopting them when they suit our needs;
a strict commitment to one moral code is nothing but a lie a ruler tells themselves
and which is liable to lead them astray.
 
The most prominent legalist philosopher from the time after Shang Yang is
Shènzi (born Shen Dao).9 Shènzi was born in Zhao (the home state of Xunzi) and lived during the lifetimes of Mengzi, Shang Yang, and Xunzi. Other than the
location of his birth, we know very little about his life; that he was a member of the
Jixia Academy, and that he is likely to have left it after it was captured by the state of
Yan. From here, he may have ended up encountering legalism upon moving to the state of Han, where he is thought to have lived for about ten years before passing
away. During his lifetime he wrote forty-two essays, only seven fragments of which
survive to this day. This means that understanding his work involves reading the
accounts of his views provided by others and understanding them in reference to those surviving fragments. While original materials and biographical information are
scant for Shènzi, he was still a major contributor to our current understanding of
legalism.
 
Of those surviving fragments, one sentiment is especially relevant for understanding legalism: “even if the law is not good, it is better than having no law at
all.”10 This gives us something of the flavor of legalist political philosophy. Since the
legalists’ answer to the problem of social cohesion was to achieve order through the
law, the law required enforcement. While the masses were likely to welcome the
capacity for promotion that legalism brought, and its insistence on punishing nobles in the same way that it did commoners, punishments, overall, were severe and
plentiful in the legalism-dominated Qin dynasty. This can be seen in at least three
ways. First, there were steep punishments for seemingly minor crimes. For instance,
those who studied banned books were punished with execution. Second, kin punishment became the standard in states adhering to legalism. For instance, capital
punishments like treason would result in sentences like the ‘nine familial
 
9 Shènzi (Shen Dao) should not be confused with Shēnzi (Shen Buhai), another legalist philosopher from ancient China who is known for arguing that rulers should not trust their ministers because they will only seek to usurp their power. 
10 Eirik Lang Harris, The Shenzi Fragments: A Philosophical Analysis and Translation (New York: Columbia University Press, 2016): 47. 
 
64 exterminations’ (‘mie zu’). Here, not only would the offender be sentenced to death, but also their 1) living parents, 2) living grandparents, 3) older children (younger
children were sentenced to slavery) and, if married, their spouses, 4) older
grandchildren and, if married, their spouses (following the same rule for younger grandchildren), 5) siblings and siblings-in-law, 6) aunts and uncles (including their
spouses), 7) cousins, 8) spouse, and 9) spouse’s living parents. Finally, legalism
introduced the concept of ‘mutual surveillance’. According to this, family members,
neighbors, and associates were expected to pay attention to the behavior of those
around them and report suspicious or illegal activity to the authorities. Those who knew of a crime and failed to stop it were sentenced to the same punishment as those
that committed the crime. These legalist reforms around punishment would
eventually come back to bite some of their advocates, like when (as mentioned
earlier) Shang Yang himself was subject to these nine familial exterminations. Nevertheless, while these punishments were presented as part of legalism’s alternative
model to that of Confucianism, it was not entirely independent of Confucianism’s
focus on the family unit. Indeed, the later Tang Code would synthesize legalism’s
harsh punishments with Confucianism’s focus on the family unit. It enforced filial piety through the legal system and punished those who victimize family members
more than those who victimize strangers, even when they committed the same crime.
Thus, legalism was impartial when it came to enforcing the law, but within the law
itself, there was still room for the kinds of special familial obligations that were the more traditional realm of Confucianism.
 
The last of the central legalist philosophers is Han Fei, who is credited with synthesizing and improving upon the work of his predecessors in a text called the
Han Feizi. Han Fei was born to the ruling aristocracy of the central state of Han (in
modern day Shanxi and Henan provinces). He is said to have been a student of Xunzi’s and Han Fei’s work can be seen as synthesizing Xunzi’s cynical view of
human nature with legalism’s answer to how to cultivate that nature. Despite his
high station, he was apparently passed over when it came to advising the rulers of
Han due to his stutter. Frustration over this eventually led Han Fei to take up the offer of Ying Zheng, the king of Qin, to come and consult for that state. Ying was an
ardent believer in Han’s ideas, but Han Fei got their meeting off on a bad footing. In
his first essay presented to the court in Qin, Han Fei asked the king not to invade
 
65
Han Fei’s native state of Han. Han’s former friend (and a fellow student of Xunzi’s),
Li Si, seized the opportunity and worked to get Han Fei imprisoned for loyalty to the
state of Han. Han Fei advocated for his own release and this work eventually
convinced the king to release him. However, by the time this happened, Li Si had already forced Han Fei to commit suicide by ingesting poison.
 
While Han Fei is most often regarded as bringing together the work of his
predecessors and making smaller variations on them, his work does articulate the
legalist theory of history. In this case, that is the evolutionary theory of history.
On this model, the past is characterized by a state in which “the people were few
whereas the goods were plenty; hence people did not compete.”11 This is a view
about the state of nature. The state of nature is a hypothetical or actual state of
humans living together but without any social structures (such as governments). In
this case, people get along but not because they are innately well-intentioned like Mengzi would have us believe. Instead, their nature is indifferent (echoing Han Fei’s
mentor Xunzi), and their behavior is dictated by the material conditions of their lives
(in this case, those of abundance). However, as the situation changes, with resources
becoming scarce and many differing views on how it should be allocated, conflict emerges. In this way, the state of nature leads to a state of abundance which, in turn,
will lead to the necessity of law, which can regulate the allocation of resources so as
to avoid conflict. In this way, legalism’s laws present themselves as the source of
order rather than Confucian traditions.
 
This picture is notable for a few reasons. First, it is a very early account of the state of nature. Much later philosophers will still be interested in explaining what
life was or would be like in the absence of government, and in using that to explain
the authority of governments, but this articulation may be among the first in the
world.12 Second, the evolutionary theory of history provides us with a model of the ‘circumstances of justice’. These are the conditions under which it makes sense to
 
11 Yuri Pines, “Legalism in Chinese Philosophy,” Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, December 10, 2014, https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-legalism/. 12 The question of the state of nature will be taken up again in the “The Empiricists” chapter by philosophers like Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Further, both Han Fei’s account of the state of nature and his solution (an absolute monarch) are the same as those provided by Hobbes.  
 
66 raise the question of how goods and resources ought to be distributed. This question
can be called the ‘problem of distributive justice’. Most interestingly, the account of
the circumstances of justice that is provided here is strikingly similar to that
independently arrived at by later philosophers across the world.13
 
Daoism 
 
The exact dates of Laozi’s (born Li Er and sometimes rendered Lao Tzu) birth and death are difficult to pin down, but he was likely a contemporary of
Kongzi’s, making him one of the earliest known philosophers in China. He was born
in the state of Chu during the Zhou dynasty and is thought to have worked as the
Keeper of the Archives in the Zhou's royal court, which would have given him access to a wide array of classic texts. Laozi went on to form his own views on the basis of
this reading and attract a number of followers (though he never opened his own
school formally). In one illustrative story, he is said to have grown tired of city life in
old age and left Chu for the state of Qin, where he could live as a hermit. As he was leaving through the gate, he was spotted by a guard who recognized him. The guard
asked him to stop and write down his teachings before leaving. Laozi rather quickly
(it is said to have been written in one night) and somewhat indifferently composed a
text, now known as the Tao Te Ching, and left through the gate, disappearing into the wilderness and from public attention forever. This story tells us something of
Laozi’s philosophy. Whereas Confucian and legalist philosophers seemed to
constantly be working towards having some influence in the affairs of state, Laozi
was content to form his own view, teach it to those who sought it out, and let the matter of his influence sort itself out. This would come to be characteristic of his
philosophy, which is now called Daoism.
 
If Han Fei comes down on the side of Xunzi with regards to human nature
(that is, that it isn’t good), Daoism goes a step beyond Mengzi (that it contains the
 
13 Among those are David Hume (discussed in the “The Scottish Enlightenment” chapter) and John Rawls (discussed in the “Political & Social Philosophy” chapter).  
 
67 seeds of goodness which require cultivation). Daoism offers an optimistic and
positive view of human nature. Instead, the skepticism is reserved for the schemes of
rulers and philosophers. In this way, we can think of Daoism as combining the
cheery picture of human nature that we find in Mengzi with the contextualist and pluralist approach of the legalists. The world, according to Daoism, is characterized
by a number of paths or ‘ways’ (‘dao’). First, there are human daos. These are possible paths one could take, which are characterized by language. For instance,
Confucianism and Mohism are human daos. These are proposed ways of moving
about the world which are the product of human invention. Contrast these with the way the natural world is. This way is, it is not merely possible. We may choose to take
this human way (Confucianism) or that human way (Mohism) but, in either case,
our path is constrained by the world as describable by science. This way just is.
Grander still, is the ‘great way’; the sum of all that was, is, or will be. The great dao includes the dao of nature but reaches beyond what is and beyond the physical. The
great way is the ultimate reality of the universe and the substance behind the curtain
of nature; it is a solution to the problem of the one and the many. Once we recognize
this reality and see that this is the way things are going, it makes little sense to focus on what is merely possible. Instead of forming human daos (and doing guesswork),
we could just recognize the dao of nature, which issues from the great dao, and just
get on board the project which is already unfolding with or without us.
 
In this way, the dao is a description of the universe but it is also a prescription for how we ought to act. The force of that prescription is in the fact
that the way of nature is already unfolding and to struggle against it is just to spin
one’s wheels. Accordingly, it might be better to think about the dao of nature and
the great dao as a stream. On a map, a stream will look like a winding path that we
can choose to go down or not, but from inside the stream, the path is not just possible; it has a substance to it which flows and pulls us along with it. Of course, we
can struggle upstream, but we can’t divert the stream. The force of nature pulls in
one direction and recognizing that allows us to work smarter, not harder. By working
with the flow of the dao of nature, we have a path of least resistance. Where Confucianism and Mohism are projects of human engineering, like all human
artifacts, they will ultimately erode under the force of nature. This tells that, instead,
 
68
1) we should follow our nature and 2) that the human daos describable by language
are liable to lead us astray.
 
While Laozi can be credited with founding Daoism, the philosopher most
important to working out its philosophical implications in detail is Zhuangzi (born
Zhuang Zhou). Not much is known about Zhuangzi’s life beyond the fact that he was from the state of Song (the modern-day landlocked province of Anhui in eastern
China) and that he served as a minor official there. Beyond this, there are plenty of
stories which may or may not be true. One such story involves Zhuangzi being
invited to take a job for the King of Chu. Zhuangzi asks the messengers who deliver this invitation to recall the shell of a large tortoise which hangs in the palace of the
king, and which is used in ritual practice there. Zhuangzi asks them whether they
think the tortoise preferred to be killed and its shell used in this way (giving it a
lasting impact in the affairs of state in Chu) or to simply continue to drag its tail in the mud. The answer seems obviously to be that it would prefer to wallow around in
the mud. With that, Zhuangzi replies, “Go away! I’ll drag my tail in the mud!”14 
Characteristic stories like this, many of which involve Zhuangzi engaged in
conversation with his philosophical friends, give us something of the flavor of Zhuangzi’s Daoism; action in inaction (not going to Chu), the futility of
philosophical advising, and a preference for what is natural.
 
One particularly important Daoist concept which Zhuangzi elaborates on is
that of action-in-inaction (‘wu-wei’). As we have seen, Daoism holds that we ought
to prefer the way of nature to the human ways. Wu-wei is the paradigm case of humans acting according to the way of nature. Here, we can contrast the effortful,
conscious, and deliberate acting according to duty that we find in Confucianism
with the natural embodied action of wu-wei. To illustrate this model, Zhuangzi
provides us with the allegory of the dexterous butcher. In this story, a king observes a butcher who appears so skilled at carving an ox that it is like watching a
trained dancer during a performance. The butcher’s movements are so fluid and
effortless that the king asks him how he is able to possess such skill. The butcher
responds by explaining that chefs who cut must sharpen their knives with great
 
14 Zhuangzi, The Complete Works of Zhuangzi, trans. Burton Watson (New York: Columbia University Press, 2013), 137. 
 
69 frequency, chipping the blade on the bone. By contrast, the butcher, through his
craft, no longer sees the ox, decides to cut in certain spots and in certain ways, and
then acts. Instead, he has gotten to a point where the object recedes from
consciousness altogether and the blade simply slips between the bones. Where a novice chef might guide the knife through the joints, the butcher allows the natural
ligaments and tendons to guide his blade.
 
This story tells us a few things about wu-wei as a guide for action. First, the
dao of nature appears to be a kind of practical knowledge. Where declarative
knowledge consists in facts and rules (like those a chef might learn in a book on butchery), practical knowledge is learned through experience and isn’t exercised in
recalling propositions, but in action. The novice chef uses rationality to decide what
to do; the butcher has learned through experience and allows his refined instincts to
guide him. Second, Zhuangzi provides us with an astute observation about the practical knowledge of tool-use. When the butcher uses his knife, it disappears from
his experience. He doesn’t see or think about the knife or the oxen. Instead, he thinks
through them towards the end of completing his task. Finally, nature itself provides
guidelines for action. The tendons will move the blade toward the right spot, while effort to control the blade is not only pointless but will make the butcher less
effective by dulling the blade. This is the model for how we should act (in
accordance with the dao of nature), and how rulers should act. In this way, Daoism
has now arrived at a solution to the problem of social cohesion; rulers ought to act-in-inaction. By giving up on pretensions to micromanage affairs of state, and let their
ministers guide their own domains, rulers can act more effectively and efficiently,
producing a thriving and stable society.
 
Another famous passage from Zhuangzi involves a discussion between him
and another philosopher, Huizi. As they are walking and talking, they pass over a dam. While looking down at the river, Zhuangzi comments that the fish below are
content fish having fun. Huizi responds, “You aren’t a fish. Whence do you know
the happiness of fish?”15 Zhuangzi answers by asking “You aren’t me. Whence do
you know I don’t know the happiness of fish?”16 Huizi answers that while he is not
 
15 A.C. Graham, Chuang-Tzŭ: The Inner Chapters (London: George Allen & Unwin), 123. 16 Graham, Chuang-Tzŭ, 123. 
 
70
Zhuangzi, he knows that Zhuangzi is not a fish and that is enough to count against
Zhuangzi knowing about the happiness of fish. Finally, Zhuangzi responds by
pointing out that Huizi’s initial question actually assumed that Zhuangzi knew of
the happiness of fish, and only asks from where he derived this knowledge. To this,
Zhuangzi answers “I knew it from up above the [river] Hao.”17 This thought
experiment, about how we could know the mental states of animals, is called the
‘happiness of fish’, and packs a significant amount of philosophy into a tiny package.
 
First, this discussion raises the problem of animal minds. This is the
question of what the mental life of animals (in this case, a fish) is like.18 Questions about whether animals can be happy, under what circumstances, and how we can
know are philosophically interesting in their own right, but they will also ultimately
weigh on issues in animal ethics. Second, Zhuangzi connects this problem to the
problem of other minds. This is the question of how we can know that other people have minds like our own. Of course, we might think it is obvious. After all, those
people talk to us about their thoughts, desires, and experiences. However, couldn’t a
sufficiently advanced robot model the way that humans talk about their mental life
without having one of their own? Questions like this still dominate discussions in the philosophy of mind. Finally, while these questions are raised, they are not raised in
order for Zhuangzi to answer them, but so that he can use them to make a larger
point about Huizi’s skepticism. Skepticism, as a philosophical position, is
characterized by a general reluctance to grant that we know something. This can run from skepticism about some particular phenomenon or philosophical topic to
‘global skepticism’ about whether any knowledge is possible at all. Huizi is skeptical
of Zhuangzi’s ability to answer the problem of animal minds, and Zhuangzi responds
by arguing that this might also entail skepticism about the problem of other minds
due to a similarity between the two problems. When Huizi resists this conclusion, Zhuangzi argues that the skeptic can’t coherently raise their worries about the
knowledge of others because the act of raising these worries presupposes the
possibility of knowledge. In this way, while philosophers offer a wide variety of
 
17 Graham, Chuang-Tzŭ, 123. 
18 This problem is taken up in a big way in the 20th century when the philosopher Thomas Nagel writes an influential paper in which he asks us to imagine what it is like to be a bat. Thomas Nagel, “What is it Like to be a Bat?” Philosophical Review 83, no. 4 (1974): 435-450. 
 
71 interpretations of this story, one might be that Zhuangzi is arguing against global
skepticism here.
 
The School of Names 
 
Huizi (born Hui Shi), not content to just be a side character in the life of
Zhuangzi, is an important philosopher in his own right. Little is known about his life
other than that he, like Zhuangzi, lived in the state of Song, and that he likely worked as a government official. While none of his writings survive, he does appear as a
character in the writings of many others (as we have already seen). His reputation is
one of a purveyor of paradoxes and a master at making and providing analogies. In
philosophy, a paradox is a logically self-contradictory statement or set of statements. Typically, a paradox is raised as a potential consequence of a certain view, and then it
is argued that we should abandon that view in order to avoid self-contradiction. This
style became characteristic of the School of Names (its members are sometimes
known as ‘the logicians’). Where the other philosophical camps we have so far discussed in ancient China were principally concerned with the problem of social
cohesion, philosophers from the school of names stand out due to their concern for
logic and rhetoric. Instead of developing their own positive view of how kings should
rule and spending their time advising them, these philosophers tended to engage in ‘disputations’ and teach others how to do the same. In this case, philosophers in this
camp might merely raise problems for the accounts, claims, and advice offered by
other schools and instruct their students on the ways of arguing so that they could
defend or arm themselves in litigation.19
 
This general approach to philosophy (along with stories about lives of these individual philosophers) reveal something of their philosophical disposition, even if
they never articulate a positive doctrine of their own. In general, adherents to the
school of names, like Huizi, endorse a form of skepticism about the power of
 
19 In this way, they are strikingly similar to the Sophists of Ancient Greece, discussed in the “Socrates” chapter. 
 
72 argumentation, reason, and philosophical theorizing. The limits of reason are
certainly pushed to their extreme in Huizi’s ‘ten theses’. They are listed below:
 
1.   The largest thing has nothing beyond it; it is the One of largeness.
The smallest thing has nothing within it; it is the One of smallness.
 
2.   That which has no thickness cannot be piled up; yet it is a thousand
‘li’ in dimension (roughly 333 miles).
 
3.   Heaven is as low as Earth; mountains and marshes are on the same
level.
 
4.   The sun at noon is the sun setting. The thing born is the thing
dying.
 
5.   Great similarities are different from little similarities; these are
called the little similarities and differences. The ten thousand things
are all similar and are all different; these are called the great
similarities and differences.
 
6.   The southern region has no limit and yet has a limit.
 
7.   I set off for Yueh today and came there yesterday.
 
8.   Linked rings can be separated.
 
9.   I know the center of the world: it is north of Yen and south of
Yueh.
 
10. Let love embrace the ten thousand things: Heaven and Earth are a
single body.
 
While these ten theses are quite cryptic, and much has been written and
speculated on about them, two are worth discussing in detail here. First, notice the
fourth thesis: the sun at noon is the sun setting. This can be read as a point about contextualism. The sun simply is where it is in space. Nevertheless, at any given time
we might say that it is setting or rising, but the truth of this statement depends on
our occupying a particular perspective in relation to it. In this way, the point of the
paradox is a point about the contextual nature of truth; a point which might also be popular among the context-sensitive legalists. The other thesis we might want to
mention specifically is the second. This paradox draws on the finite divisibility of the
 
73 physical world and the infinite divisibility of mathematical geometry. We are often
told that a segment of line (here represented as concerning thickness) is composed of
a series of points, but these points themselves are said to have no length, width, or
thickness. Accordingly, by making a segment of line we are supposed to have made
something from nothing.20 The legalists use these puzzles as a testament to the
futility of reasoning altogether. Philosophers have been using reason to try to
understand the world, but what good is reason if it leads to such paradoxical
conclusions? Thus, between these two theses alone, we can see the core of the
philosophy to which the school of names adheres; a skepticism about rationality and about metaphysical and moral speculation which claims an objective standpoint.
 
The second famous member of the school of names is Gongsun Long. Like
Huizi, little is now known of his life and only five of the fourteen essays he is
thought to have written survive. He was born in the state of Zhao, and where Huizi was a contemporary of Zhuangzi, Gongsun Long’s life most closely overlaps with
that of Xunzi. Other than this, various texts depict him as an advisor to the Lord of
Pingyuan (a location in Zhao) and having advised multiple parties against war.
Long’s reputation against armed conflict may constitute the bulk of what we can say about his political philosophy or political philosophy within the school of names.
Where Mozi counseled peace on the basis of its good consequences, Gongsun would
advocate for it on the basis of the same contextualism we saw in Huizi. In one
famous story, the state of Zhao is at risk of being dragged into a conflict between Qin and Wei. Zhao had signed an agreement in which Zhao and Qin would assist one
another in anything either wished to do. When Qin attacked Wei, they were annoyed
that Zhao didn’t follow suit. Upon their complaining that Zhao was required to
follow suit, Gongsun, representing Zhao, reminded the representatives of Qin that
they were as obligated to follow suit in Zhao’s coming to the rescue of Wei. In this case, either perspective could claim to be aggrieved, and what exactly the treaty
demands depends on whose context we occupy.
 
20 Similar paradoxes, concerning the relationship between mathematical geometry and actual space, are posed by the Presocratic philosopher Zeno of Elea. More can be read about Zeno and his paradoxes in the “The Presocratics” chapter. 
 
74
Most famous of Gongsun Long’s writings, however, is the white horse 
discourse. In this text, Gongsun defends the claim that ‘white horses are not horses’ against an interlocutor. Interpretations of the text are many and varied, but the crux
of the problem might be that our act of predicating with the words ‘are’ or ‘is’ actually allows us to specify two different kinds of relationships. On one account of
‘is’, we mean the identity relation. For instance, ‘Bruce Wayne is Batman’ means that
if you meet Bruce Wayne, then you thereby meet Batman, and that if you meet
Batman, then you thereby meet Bruce Wayne. This is to say that you are Batman if 
and only if you are Bruce Wayne. By contrast, we can also use these predicates to specify membership within a class or category. For instance, ‘Horses are animals’
means that if you meet a horse, then you thereby meet an animal. This does not
entail, contrary to the identity relationship, that if you meet an animal, you thereby
necessarily meet a horse. White horses are horses in the second sense, because they make up a subclass of horses, but it is not true that ‘white horses are horses’ in the
first sense, because the two classes are not identical. Slipping between these two uses
of ‘are’ allows Gongsun to argue against the statement that ‘white horses are horses’
and thereby demonstrate that even the truth of simple sentences depends on some contextual information about what the speaker is trying to do with their words.
 
Ban Zhao 
 
While there are a great deal many more philosophers in and from China,
either from the Hundred Schools of Thought or outside of them, the summary so
far should be enough to serve as a general introduction to the problems, positions, and figures which emerged out of ancient China. However, there is one more
thinker worth discussing here, precisely because she does not fall so cleanly into any
of the schools so far mentioned; that is Ban Zhao. She was born more than 300
years after the last of the philosophers we have so far discussed, during the rule of the Eastern Han dynasty and to a wealthy and important family. In her own time, she
might have been better known as a historian than as a philosopher. This is because
she took up the unfinished work of her father, who was himself a historian, at the
 
75 behest of Emperor He. The resulting work, a 300-year history of the Western Han
dynasty titled The Book of Han, would make her famous. Besides this, she is known
to have married at a young age and to have refused to remarry when her husband
died. Her insistence on not remarrying is often taken to be a testament to her character, which was touted throughout Chinese history. This reputation also led to
her being recruited by the same Emperor He to teach the women of the court
manners and proper conduct. Her views about these matters are discussed at length
in her work, Lessons for Women. This work is where we find the bulk of her
philosophical contributions as well.
 
Lessons for Women stands out as a text written by a woman and for women,
which is exceedingly rare in the pre-modern world. In fact, it might be the oldest
surviving work of feminist philosophy.  While defining feminism (like defining
anything) is a matter of significant philosophical dispute, it might be enough to say
here that feminism, as a philosophical position, is the view that men and women are, and ought to be treated in society, as moral equals. Working out of the details of
this is the project of feminist philosophy. Counting against the feminist
interpretation of Ban’s work is the observation that most of Ban Zhao’s advice for women involves counseling them to be mediocre rather than exceptional at
anything, and to be obedient and humble in serving their husband and in-laws. Yet
despite this, we might still consider it as a contribution to feminist philosophy. First,
to have written the book is to already recognize that women’s ideas about what it means to be a good woman matter. Even if Ban Zhao advocates for a subservient role
for women, she does so on her own terms and for reasons rather than merely as the
result of a plain expression of male power over women. Second, it employs the
conceptual frameworks of Confucianism and Daoism in order to argue for at least
some limited rights for women despite its regressive prescriptions about their behavior.
 
With regards to the influence of Daoism, we see the influence of the
association between men and yang and between women and yin. While male Daoists
might be tempted to end their analysis with the fact that yang controls yin and, therefore, men should control women, both yin and yang serve an essential role in
the nature of the world, Ban Zhao argues for a mutual respect between women and
men. After all, we need both, the yin and the yang. This means that, while Ban Zhao
 
76 is led to endorse a traditional role for women, men must not also content themselves
to being served by women without respecting what they do. The basis for this
respect, as we have seen, is the underlying metaphysics of Daoism. With regards to
Confucianism, Ban argues against the views expressed in the Confucian classic the Book of Rites, which contended that only male children ought to be educated. A male
Confucianist might think that this subordinate position in education is simply an
expression of the rectification of names when it comes to men and women. Women’s
role is simply to be subservient, and education is thusly ruled out. By contrast, Ban
Zhao appeals to the fact that Kongzi advocated for virtue ethics, and that the rectification of names when it comes to wives involves women embodying womanly
virtues. These womanly virtues require cultivation like all of the others, and that
cultivation requires education. Ban Zhao points out that she was only able to avoid
disgracing her family and husband on account of her own education. While modern audiences might want a defense of the education of women that doesn’t depend on
their obligations to their husband, this argument doesn’t aim to show that women
ought to be educated, but that Confucianism entails that they ought to be. This is
likely to have given her more traction in persuading her audience than simply asserting her case from first principles. In the end, then, Ban Zhao has shown that
the metaphysical and ethical systems of both Daoism and Confucianism require the
recognition of certain rights for women and a basic level of respect. This is the sense
in which Lessons for Women can be said to be an early work of feminist philosophy.
 
A great deal more can be said about Ban Zhao and about philosophy in east
Asia. Philosophy continued on in China and Confucianism (to take one example)
spread throughout the region. For instance, neo-Confucianism eventually plays a
significant role in Korean philosophy. Fully capturing the details of these threads
requires time, space, and careful attention. Yet, the discussion so far should be adequate to serve as an introduction into the vast and rich world of Chinese
philosophy. Many of the problems and positions which emerge onto the world stage
here lie dormant in Europe until much later thinkers are motivated by circumstance
to pick them up anew, often retreading the well-worn paths already laid by philosophers like Xunzi, Mozi, and Ban Zhao. Others still could, perhaps, only have
emerged out of the context of ancient China and thus require our revisiting the past
to encounter their fullest expression.

The Presocratics 
 
The story of philosophy in Europe is said to begin with the Presocratic Greeks, with the term ‘Presocratic’ here referring to the time in Greek antiquity
before the life and death of Socrates. The accuracy of this statement is debatable.
First, a few of the philosophers who are called Presocratics were actually
contemporaries of Socrates (as we will see). Second, many of the earliest Greek philosophers were from Ionia, a coastal region in what was once called Anatolia (or
what we would now call the Asia Minor region of modern-day Turkey). In the sixth
century B.C.E., when our story begins, Ionia was occupied by a number of Greek
colonies along its coast. As such, if philosophy in this tradition was started by the Presocratic Greeks, it at least didn’t start in Greece. Third, being in Ionia also put
these thinkers into contact with Babylonia (in present-day Iraq and Syria) and Egypt.
Many of the Presocratic philosophers traveled widely around the Mediterranean, and
there is evidence that they were influenced by the mathematics that had a foothold in both of these regions. Accordingly, if the identity of a tradition is fixed by its starting
point, then the tradition which has come to dominate Europe might be better
thought of as Egyptian philosophy or Babylonian philosophy rather than Western or
European philosophy. Finally, whether these Ionian Greeks were the first
philosophers in this tradition or not depends on how we construe ‘philosophy’. If mathematical problem-solving is counted as a form of argument, then perhaps the
Egyptians and Babylonians, who seemed to know of the Pythagorean theorem 1,000
years before Pythagoras, made arguments substantive enough to count as the first
philosophy. While these matters are of important historical and scholarly dispute, we can at least say that the greater Mediterranean tradition, consisting of thinkers who
cite their known particular predecessors and provide reasons for their own claims in
 
81 relation to them (a tradition which remains active today), extends at least back to the
Greek colonists of the Ionian coast in present-day Turkey. As such, it is there that we
begin this chapter of our story.
 
The Milesians 
 
The earliest of the Greek philosophers are concerned, like the earliest of the
Indian philosophers, with the problem of the one and the many. That is, the search for a principle substance which both unifies the different parts of the physical world,
and which explains the diversity of these parts. The first person that we are aware of
in the tradition to have proposed and argued for their own solution was Thales,
who was born to a wealthy and prominent family in Miletus (a Greek Ionian colony). Thales was apparently very well educated. Of this we have the evidence
provided by two stories about his life. First, he is supposed to have predicted an
eclipse which occurred in 585 B.C.E., and which was famous for stopping a war
between the Lydians and the Medes (two other Ionian city-states). Second, we are also told that he was able to predict a bumper crop of olives based on meteorology,
and to have made himself rich by buying up olive presses in anticipation of it.
Beyond this, he is attributed with making the first known mathematical discovery in
Greece and is now known as the ‘father of science’, the father of ‘Western
philosophy’, and the founder of the Milesian school. This was a group of Presocratic philosophers who posited natural, almost scientific, answers to the
problem of the one and the many by arguing that the underlying principle was some
natural, observable element (e.g., earth, air, water, fire, etc.).
 
While we know little of the details about or reasons for Thales' answer to the question of the cause of the diversity of the universe, we do know that he thought
that the ultimate principle was water. We can call this Thales’ doctrine of water.
However, Thales is less remembered for his particular answer than he is for what his
answer represented. Previous attempts to explain the universe had grounded those explanations in religious belief. Thales’ account was a departure from more common
mythological stories which saw events in the world as the products of unseen gods
and their actions in the past. Instead, his theory was almost pre-scientific, in that it
 
82 aimed to explain the present by appealing to natural phenomena which are
observable to us now. As mentioned already, we don’t exactly know why he thought
that the principle was water, but there are at least three reasons why someone might
think this. First, water at least has the ability to change states. If all of the things in the world are made out of something, then this ability makes water a good bet for
what that thing may be. After all, we know it can at least be a liquid, steam, and ice.
Few other natural substances are as flexible. Second, water is necessary for life. In
order to generate a tree from a seed, we must water it, and in order to continue living,
we must drink. Finally, water cycles through nature. Environmental and biological systems are maintained by the movement of water through evaporation and
precipitation.
 
Two other Milesians also stand out as especially important in the history of
philosophy: Anaximander, and Anaximenes. Rather than a natural substance like
water, Anaximander posited that the principle of the universe was, simply, a boundless something (referred to as ‘the boundless’) which all things arise from and
which they will all return to. We can call this thesis the doctrine of the boundless.
Like in the case of Thales, we know little of his reasons for thinking this. However, one issue with Thales’ explanation is that it is unclear how everything could be, at
bottom, water. For instance, there are dry things in the world and how could we
make what is dry from what is wet? The same problem would arise for any principle
which has an opposite. If the substance is dry it will struggle to explain what is wet, and if it is heavy, it will struggle to explain what is light. The list goes on. What we
need, then, is a principle which has no opposite. Such a substance, however, will
have no distinct features of its own. Once we commit to it being one way, we will
wonder how it could become another. Accordingly, the boundless is infinite and
indeterminate, however mysterious this may be.
 
Yet, even if we think that Anaximander’s solution to the problem of the one
and the many is more compelling than Thales’, we might still wonder how the
diversity of the universe emerges from the boundless. Here, Anaximander appeals to
its vortex motion. Just as a centrifuge can spin until the component ingredients of a mixture are separated out, the diverse array of things in the universe are the result of
the swirling, chaotic boundless forcing like ingredients to clump together. Why
think that like elements are spinning out in their own direction? For one, all fire
 
83 seems to strive upward while rocks fall back toward the rocky earth. In the same way,
the tides push and pull seemingly on their own. This model of the universe and its
creation can be called the theory of the vortex.
 
Beyond addressing the problem of the one and the many, Anaximander also
developed his own biological theories. Here, he argued that all life originated in the sea, and that the diversity of kinds of animals that exist now is a consequence of
adaptation within new environments. He observed that some sharks give live birth
and, accordingly, thought that they must represent an intermediary stage between
fish and land animals. This might strike us today as surprisingly similar to the theory of evolution in modern science. After all, it was uncommon, historically, to think
that humans descended from other animals. However, for Anaximander, this was
not a gradual process across generations. Indeed, his reasoning for thinking that
humans must have emerged from another form of life also proves to block him from positing the slow process of natural selection. He observes, first, that young humans
require a significant period of nursing when compared to other animals. If this had
always been the case, then the earliest humans would not have survived. As such, it
must not have always been the case. Instead, Anaximander’s solution to this problem is that humans must have originally developed as embryos inside of fish-like
creatures, which moved from the sea to the land. These animals would have
eventually burst open, and the humans inside, having by then reached puberty,
could provide for themselves.
 
Meanwhile, Anaximenes treaded closer to Thales by arguing that air (including mist) is the underlying principle of the universe. However, he differed
from Thales in thinking that this air is large and contains a correspondingly infinite
number of worlds. Here, Anaximenes draws an analogy between the soul and air as
the principle of the universe. He tells us that the soul, being weightless and associated with breathing, is air, and it is what unifies the parts of the body under a single
identity. Thus, the same is true for the universe. Air is also thought to have been a
particularly good candidate for the underlying principle of the world because 1) it
surrounds the entire earth, and 2) breathing air is essential for life. In line with this theory, he also argued that the earth must be shaped like a flat circle, and that it
floated through the infinite air like a flying disc. We can call Anaximenes’ answer to
 
84 the problem of the one and the many, that air is the principle of all things, the
doctrine of air.
 
While many of these theories may sound silly to us now, what the Milesians
show us is that, in its beginnings, philosophy and science are one continuous project
of understanding the world. These thinkers posit answers to philosophical problems but also develop biological and astronomical theories as well. They are interested in
natural processes, and they posit natural explanations for them. Particularly, they
appear to have been especially interested in matters that we might expect to draw the
attention of a sea-fairing coastal people: meteorology, astrology, and the biology of marine animals. Yet, while modern scientists might want to claim them as their own,
this point in Presocratic philosophy also sees the emergence of questions that science
is no closer to solving now than it was then. One of these more straightforwardly
philosophical questions concerns the concept of change.
 
The Milesians had simply assumed the fact of change. After all, it is self-
evident for Thales that water changes from liquid to gas and solid to liquid.
However, they also recognized the fact of unity. The problem of the one and the
many assumes that there is, indeed, some underlying unity to the world that we can ultimately uncover. However, the project of reconciling unity and change soon
asserts itself as of enormous philosophical importance. The issue is that change
describes things being different now than they were in the past or different in the
future than they are now. Unfortunately, this is not all there is to say about change.
Change also requires some continuity across time. Take, for example, a door which has been painted from red to black. If there were no continuity, then there would be
no change, only a red door and then a different black door. To change the color of
the door is to make that very door different than it once was. However, we might
wonder in what sense it is the same door if it is different; the door before was red and this one is black! We can call the problem of reconciling the persistence of identity
with the possibility of change, the problem of change. The next step in Greek
philosophy was that of bringing the problem of change fully into focus, and we find
answers to this problem in both Heraclitus and in Parmenides and his successors, the Eleatics.
 
85
Heraclitus 
 
If the problem of change is one of figuring out whether to either deny
change or to deny the persistence of identity in favor of the other, the side of change
was championed by Heraclitus. He was an Ephesian (another Greek Ionian colony)
and also came from a well-to-do family. While little else is known of his life, we can
speak to the political circumstances of Ionia during his time. Politics in Heraclitus’ world would drive nothing home for those that lived through it if it didn’t
demonstrate the inevitability of change. War was common between the Ionian city-
states, and Persia loomed large as a threat to all of the Greek colonists. Regimes were
routinely established and toppled. Further, civil strife within each city represented a threat to one’s stability. New rulers were popping up daily, leveraging negative
public opinion, and establishing themselves only to become tyrants in their own
right. Heraclitus would have suffered from this violence and turmoil, and the
tendency for common people to allow themselves to be manipulated must have turned him away from social life and towards philosophy. He garnered a reputation
for gloom and misanthropy, and this earned him the nickname of ‘the Weeping
Philosopher’. Meanwhile, the dense and enigmatic nature of his writings led to
another title: Heraclitus the Obscure. Socrates would even go as far as to say that Heraclitus’ writings require a diver to get to the meaning of. These works, titled “On
Nature”, only survive in fragments now.
 
As mentioned above, it is commonly asserted that Heraclitus tries to solve
the problem of change by simply denying that any such thing as permanence exists at
all. In defense of this interpretation, we might look at his famously saying that ‘you can’t step in the same river twice.’ This simple, widespread characterization of
Heraclitus’ view, which is called the doctrine of flux, is at least partially attributable
to Plato, who recounts Heraclitus’ position along those lines. However, Heraclitus’
answer to the problem of change is more nuanced than it first appears. Instead of change being the opposite of a stable, persistent, unity, Heraclitus argues that this
unity is actually only made possible by the constancy of flux. Consider dirt
suspended in water. This suspension only persists so long as the water is in motion. If
all of the tides and rivers were to suddenly stop running, the sediment would settle to the bottom, and we no longer have a suspension (only separated particles and
 
86 liquid). This shows us that there are at least some kinds of things for which unity and
persistence requires a constant stirring, and Heraclitus argues that the universe is one
of those things. This account attempts to solve the problem of change by inverting
it, not by denying persistence altogether. Where there once was an apparent contradiction between the persistence of identity and the fact of change, we now see
that the unity and stability of the universe is a result of, not in opposition to, the
constant flux of change itself. This is the true doctrine of flux.
 
Not content to merely address the problem of change, Heraclitus also
attempts an answer to the problem of the one and the many. Here, he tells us that fire, not water or air, is the underlying principle of the universe. This view is
illustrated in his telling us that “there is an exchange: all things for Fire and Fire for
all things…”21 Of course, Heraclitus means this literally, just as Thales meant that the
world was literally made out of water. However, Heraclitus is driven to this conclusion precisely because of its compatibility with his answer to the problem of
change. Fire is the source of change, and change underlies all things. While he would
not have used this language, fire is a process of oxidation. It is fitting, then, that a
thinker known for championing change would pick a process rather than a static substance as underlying all of reality. The fire is, at every moment, changing while
maintaining its continuity.
 
It may seem strange to suggest that everything in the universe is composed
of fire, but the view does have its attractions. First, it is easy to see when a person dies,
that they begin to get cold. Fire as the principle of all things could easily explain this association between life and heat. Second, fire is also capable of movement without,
itself, being alive. The view is stronger still when we think about fire as the
embodiment of change. If Heraclitus is really asserting that change underlies all
things, then he isn’t too far off from modern science. The rock which seems to sit there motionless and unchanging is actually flying through space at breakneck speed
as a passenger on our world. At the same time, if we were to zoom in, the same
supposedly motionless rock is actually its own little world of buzzing atoms and
forces at play. Likewise, we ourselves are constantly changing, and changing our

87 minds with them. Our own mental life is alight with a constant stream of
consciousness. Perhaps the metaphor of a stream to describe our mental life is
especially at home in Heraclitus’ account, which illustrates itself with the picture of
an ever-moving river. If nothing else, Heraclitus’ emphasizing the side of change causes future philosophers in the tradition to take the problem of change very
seriously.
 
Yet, if Heraclitus is known to us now as the defender of change in the
problem of reconciling change and persistence, the other side is not without its own
defenders. On the one hand, it is easy to see why coming down on the side of change was an attractive prospect to Heraclitus; we can see change happening all around us.
Despite this, we know that our senses often fail us. We see an apple on the ground
from afar and, when we approach, it turns out to be a peach. We might, then, think
that reason is the more reliable of the two. If our senses can fail, and our senses indicate change, then perhaps reason can compel us to throw change out altogether.
That is, maybe apparent change is no different from the apparent apple. It is merely
the faulty information given to us by the senses and which reason can and should
overthrow. This potential solution to the problem of change is taken up by an opposing school of philosophers, who take their name from the Southern Italian city
of Elea.
 
The Eleatics
 
Xenophanes, a native of Colophon (yet another Greek Ionian colony) is
regarded as the founder of the Eleatic school. He was initially exposed to philosophy
by living in Ionia, along with the Milesians. However, he was forced to flee after the Persian conquest of the region, and he took the practice of philosophy with him on
his travels. He lived as a wandering poet, moving about the Greek world for some
time before finally arriving in the Greek Italian colony of Elea, where he would
remain until his death in old age. Beyond this simple biographic picture, we have reason to believe that he spent some time during his life as a slave, that he was
eventually freed from this, and that he outlived multiple sons. While we might
 
88 remember him more as a metaphysician, those around him might have considered
him primarily a satirist or reformer. Here, his target is the somewhat lavish culture of
the Greek colonies in Italy, which were known at the time for luxurious lifestyles,
purple garments, and their wealthy people. By contrast, Xenophanes advocated for simple living and rational reflection. Reason, temperance, and good taste were
primary virtues. He also ridiculed the predominant Greek interest in sports,
mythological stories, and politics. None of these would lead to wisdom or virtue and,
as such, none were of interest to Xenophanes. In their place, he saw value only in the
life of the mind.
 
Philosophy in Greece, like in almost all parts of the world, grew out of a
religious backdrop. Yet, at the same time, philosophy also represented a movement
away from religion. Philosophy was, by the nature of its explanations, skeptical of
the competing religious explanations of the world. If they were adequate, then there would be nothing left to explain. However, Xenophanes was not content to let this
skepticism merely be implied. He railed against the idea, which was common in his
time, that the gods were mortal; that they were born and that they were of roughly
human form. He also railed at the crimes and immoral acts committed by the gods in the poem of Homer and Hesiod. The entire Greek religious framework was corrupt
in his eyes. It wasn’t so much that religion is bankrupt or that we should be atheists,
but that the dominant Greek conception of the gods was all too human. The gods
are like us because we are the ones writing the stories. To Xenophanes, it is convenient that the gods have hands like our own. We should expect, he points out,
that if the cows wrote the stories about the gods, they would have hooves. In the
same way, each culture, Xenophanes observed, depicts the gods as looking like
themselves. Xenophanes seems to have been the first to suggest that the gods were
created in our image and not the other way around.
 
By contrast, his account of the divine begins by arguing that a god should be
radically unlike us and, thus, avoid our mortal failings. According to him, there is
only one god, who sees and knows all. Unlike us, God must be a creature with total
self-control, and, unlike us, God would not be composed of physical parts. In this way, Xenophanes does not think there is a perfect god because they have made us in
their image. Rather, God is perfect because they are entirely not like us. Despite the
account’s negative view of human nature, it might strike us as more modern (and
 
89 monotheistic) than what we might expect from ancient Greeks. However, the
monotheistic religions of our time, which most often conceive of a god that is like us,
have this god performing actions for reasons and having desires (even if those actions
and desires are thought to be more moral and rational than our own). This is not the case for Xenophanes. His god is a radical departure from our own way of being. On
top of this, Xenophanes’ God is supposed to be the ‘greatest among the gods’, so
other gods may still retain some kind of downgraded reality. For him, God is the
principle of the universe and, as such, the answer to the problem of the one and the
many. In this way, God is both eternal and unchanging, and in some sense identified with the physical world. This identification of God with nature can be called
pantheism.22
 
If Xenophanes is credited with originating the idea of a permanent and
unchanging reality in response to the problem of change, Parmenides is the one who turns the idea into a robust philosophical doctrine, and one with interesting and
important consequences. While we possess very little reliable information with
regards to the story of his life, we do possess a number of testimonies to the quality
of his thinking and his character. Indeed, he was so well-regarded that ancient Greeks eventually took to saying that they wanted to live “a life like Parmenides” as a figure
of speech.23 This should give us some indication that, whatever the specifics, his was
a life well-lived.
 
Heraclitus was driven to deny identity because change is obvious to us in
our observations of the world. By contrast, Parmenides is more than willing to deny what the senses reveal. Here, he denies the reality of change altogether. Sure, our eyes
tell us that things change, but our eyes also sometimes tell us that what is actually
blue is, in the moment, green. Like this, change is merely an illusion. It should be
pointed out that change is so widespread in our experience of life that this amounts to a wholesale denial of reality as it is experienced by us. In place of the objects of our
ordinary lives, Parmenides posits pure, undifferentiated being. This is the underlying
 
22 Pantheism is strongly associated with the later philosopher Baruch Spinoza, whose view is discussed in the “The Rationalists” chapter. 
23 Arthur Schwegler, A History of Philosophy in Epitome, trans. Julius H. Seelye (New York: D. Appleton and Company., 1864), 29. 
 
90 principle of the universe, and it is eternal, unchanging, immovable, indivisible, and
infinite. Thus, Parmenides’ solution to the problem of the one and the many is to
deny plurality altogether. We can call this the doctrine of being.
 
Parmenides is aware of the apparent absurdity of his position. Of course, we
see change all around us. However, his view doesn’t aim to capture or describe our experience of things, but to reflect what is true as revealed by reason. Facts,
themselves, are restricted by the laws of logic, and the existence of both change and
persistence has led to an untenable contradiction. We are justified in believing only
what we are justified in thinking, and we can’t assert both ideas at the same time. This may be enough to explain why we must take a side, but Parmenides recognizes
that we need further reason to choose the side of permanence over that of change.
Here, Parmenides asks us to consider movement as a paradigmatic case of change.
The movement of a ball from location a to location b is just a change in its position. Notice, though, that in order for the ball to move into b, b must be empty.
Movement requires that the moving thing has somewhere to go. That is, movement
requires some empty space for a thing to move into. The problem for Parmenides is
that, to say that there is nothing between two objects is to say that there is no thing between them. What, then, are we speaking about if it doesn’t exist in the first place?
To put the issue another way, if there was nothing between two objects, then there
would be no thing between them. That is, they would be touching. If there is
something between them (namely, some space), then that space is a thing between them and, thus, there is some thing between them. Empty space, then, cannot exist.
The empty space is either a thing or it is occupied with something else. The apparent
spaces between things are occupied by being itself, the thing of which we talk about
when we talk about the distance between objects. Again, we see that the paradoxes
revealed to us by reason give us reason, further, to deny what is given to us by the senses.
 
The problem associated with nothingness runs deeper still. Imagine we have
a chair. We (at least think we) know that chairs are impermanent. Chairs come into
being when they are made and cease to be when they are destroyed. Yet, to say that a chair came into being is to say that it, at one point, didn’t exist. The problem is,
again, that if that thing didn’t exist, then there is no thing which we can say didn’t
exist. Therefore, the chair must have always existed. If you want to argue otherwise,
 
91 we can ask “what is the thing you are saying has the property of not existing.” If you
answer, “the chair!”, we can say “Aha, then the chair did exist then!” The same is true
for the chair’s ceasing to exist. We say that the thing that once existed no longer does.
But what stopped existing? If we are able to talk and think about it, then it must exist. Thus, it exists. The result of all of this is that we are now able to say that there is
only being, which occupies all space). Further, that being has no beginning, does not
change, and has no end. If we must choose between apparent change and persistence,
Parmenides argues that reason comes down on the side of persistence.
 
While we might find this argument strange, there is no denying that it has a certain logic to it. This logic made it quite influential among the philosophers of the
era. Just as there were those that attempted to refute it, it also had its converts. The
best-known adherent to this doctrine is Zeno of Elea. Zeno takes up the general
account provided by Parmenides and strengthens it with a number of different arguments. His goal is to raise problems for the commonsense view that the ordinary
objects of perception are as they appear. He does this through the use of paradoxes.
Of his many paradoxes, which have since become famous, two thought experiments
are especially well-known. These are, respectively, 1) the flying arrow, and 2) Achilles and the tortoise. The paradox of the flying arrow begins by telling us that in order
for an arrow flying through the air to reach its destination, it must successively
occupy a series of positions. One way of thinking about this is in terms of a film. If
we filmed an arrow flying, we can slow the motion of the film down to the point of seeing individual frames. Yet, no particular frame captures the movement of the
arrow. It is simply here now and, in the next frame, slightly further towards its target.
Zeno’s argument is that this isn’t merely a byproduct of how film works. If we could
slow down, in person, the flight of the arrow, we would also only find a series of
moments in which it is mid-flight. In each of these, the arrow is simply in a particular place, and therefore at rest. Zeno demands that we show us the motion happening
and not merely an illusion of a sequence of resting states.
 
The other argument, the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise, involves the
interaction between two different motions. We are asked to imagine the Greek hero Achilles entering into a foot race with a tortoise. Achilles is either a good sport or
very confident of his ability to win the race, because he agrees to give the tortoise a
head start. After the tortoise has made it some way down the track, Achilles sets out
 
92 to pass it by. However, Achilles never can pass the tortoise, because, at the point that
he catches up to where the tortoise was when Achilles started running, the tortoise
will have gone at least a little further. Yet, by the time Achilles reaches that point, the
tortoise will have gone further still. While the tortoise’s gains are exceedingly small, there is one for every benchmark Achilles passes. Achilles must pass through an
infinite number of points along the way, and the tortoise will always stay at least a
little ahead. Thus, Achilles can never overtake the tortoise.

You might argue that the paradoxes of Eleatics like Zeno and Parmenides are

silly. We know that arrows do hit their targets, we have seen this happen. We know

that change happens because we can see it happening all around us. The Eleatics don’t deny that we see change and motion, they simply deny that we should believe

what we see. If reason, as revealed by these paradoxes, gives us reason to deny what

 
93 the senses give us, then so be it. After all, we all already do think that our senses are

wrong sometimes anyway. If the reasoning of the paradoxes is right, on what basis
can we say that the observations of motion and change are any different than optical
illusions? As you can imagine, this position generated a good deal of attention and philosophical controversy. Reasoning, now, has high stakes, and careful attention to
these arguments (in order to determine where they go wrong if they do) requires us
to establish a system of logic for analyzing our reasoning, which is a project taken up
by Zeno’s successors.
 
The Pluralists 
 
Empedocles was born in Sicily and apparently had a considerable reputation as a traveling healer. He, at one point, even turned down an offer to rule over his city.
His knowledge and skill in medicine was also enough for him to be thought to
possess supernatural powers, and it seems he might have encouraged the belief.
Knowing that his followers believed him to be a god, he wanted to avoid the embarrassment of them eventually finding his dead body. Accordingly, in order to
conceal his mortality, he is said to have thrown himself into the volcano Mt. Etna, so
that his followers would think he simply returned to the heavens. The scheme was
apparently uncovered when one of his distinctive bronze sandals was spat back out by the volcano and discovered by someone who had gone looking for him. Yet,
despite his charlatanism and religious aspirations, his philosophical work articulates a
fairly scientific worldview.
 
At its most basic, Empedocles’ philosophical system can be seen as an
attempt to synthesize the best ideas of those that came before him. Here, he takes on board the Eleatic idea that the universe is composed of unchanging being, but rather
than one simple and indivisible being, Empedocles posits four eternal and
fundamental elements. These elements are now quite famous to us: earth, air, fire,
and water. We can call Empedocles’ elemental account the doctrine of the four 
elements. This is the sense in which Empedocles can be said to endorse a form of pluralism about being: there are a plurality of fundamental principles, from which
 
94 the universe is composed. These four ‘root elements’ are thought to be equally
primary, and none is responsible for the others. Likewise, they have distinct essences,
such that one won’t ever change into another (though they can change states). From
the comingling of these four elements, we can explain the world around us. In one passage, he makes the comparison between the diversity of the universe and painting.
Artists are able to depict a great many things, and do so in a variety of different
colors, using only a small number of pigments. This creative ability is the result of
harmonizing a set of basic elements. By mixing yellow and blue, we make green, and
can thus depict the world of green things. The same, Empedocles argues, is true of the universe. Its many and varied things are the result of particular harmonizations of
the four basic elements. This picture is the key to Empedocles’ attempt to solve the
problem of change. On his account, the elements are permanent and retain their
identity, and change is merely a result of alterations in their relations to one another.
 
Beyond merely asserting the doctrine of the four elements, Empedocles is
also able to build further off of the work of Parmenides. With the Milesians,
whatever the principle was that was proposed to underlie the universe, it was taken
to be responsible for its own behavior. Heraclitus saw fire as a good candidate precisely because it is capable of self-movement. However, Parmenides, with his
story about the absolute immovability of being, divorced motion from matter. While
Empedocles’ doctrine of the four elements appears closer to the Milesians because
they had already considered the importance of natural elements, his model is genuinely post-Parmenidean. Instead of thinking that the elements move themselves,
Empedocles posits two fundamental forces which he calls ‘love’ and ‘hate’. Love
describes the attraction which mixes together the elements, and which builds
composite substances out of them. Meanwhile, hate breaks these composite mixtures
up and allows like elements to sort themselves back out. From this, Empedocles deduces that the history of the universe is one of a long historical shifting back and
forth between a total unity and total disunity of the elements. What is perhaps most
interesting about this picture is that love and hate, despite being most easily
understood as forces, are not forces as we might think of them according to modern physics. Empedocles is unable, in his time, to conceive of these things as being real
without thinking of them as taking up space. In this way, it is difficult to say why
they aren’t elements in their own right.
 
95
Outside of the problem of the one and the many, another popular question
we have already encountered in classical Indian philosophy also received some
attention from Empedocles: the problem of knowledge. Empedocles’ answer is
optimistic, simple, and derived from his metaphysics. Here, he says that we can have knowledge of everything because we, ourselves, are composed of everything. Each
element is within us; earth to make the solid parts, water to make the liquid parts, air
to make breath, and fire to make the soul. Accordingly, we can perceive and form
knowledge about the objects around us because ‘like is known by like’. Of course, we
now don’t think that our bodies contain earth, air, or fire. Likewise, knowledge doesn’t seem like it is reducible to the physical relationship between two like things.
We can also form knowledge about ideas like ‘empathy’ and ‘the number five’. Yet,
even if his account of knowledge is limited in certain ways, he is the first of the
Greeks to develop something like a scientific model of perception, and the question of how we form knowledge on the basis of perception will continue to draw
attention from philosophers through the ages.
 
Anaxagoras stands out among the Presocratics if, for no other reason than
because, with him, we have now made contact with Athens, which will come to be the center of philosophy in the Mediterranean. Anaxagoras was born in Clazomenae
(in Ionia), but he ended up in Athens sometime during the middle of the fifth
century B.C.E. There, he was among the elite of society. However, Athenian politics
soon put Anaxagoras in its crosshairs, and he was tried for impiety because he argued that the sun was a hot stone rather than a divine being. His conviction saw him
exiled to Lampsacus (a Greek colony north of Ionia), where he would spend the rest
of his life. Another aspect of Anaxagoras’ life which stands out in the history of
philosophy is his seemingly close connection to Socrates. Socrates, like Anaxagoras,
would be tried for impiety by the people of Athens, and Socrates is said to have read the work of Anaxagoras. Likewise, it is thought that Socrates was a student of
Diotima of Mantinea, and, on some historical accounts, she is thought to be the
same person as Aspasia. Aspasia, herself, was tried in Athens for impiety. This seems
plausible given that both Anaxagoras and Aspasia were associated with the Athenian statesman Pericles. If this is right, then there is a thread which connects the three
figures, in which they might be historically connected, share in a common
philosophical tradition, and were all accused of impiety. Unfortunately, we will have
 
96 to wait until we encounter Socrates and his student Plato before we can really
analyze what this chain of influence could be.
 
Where we left off, Empedocles had given us an answer to the diversity of
natural objects through his doctrine of the four elements. However, Anaxagoras
quickly concludes that this picture can’t be possible. Empedocles had thought that, for instance, bone could be explained as some mixture of basic elements. Anaxagoras’
worry is how bone, hair, and flesh could be made out of what is not itself bone, hair
or flesh. We can make a table from wood, but it is still, at the same time, wood. How,
then, do we make something out of what it is not? Anaxagoras thinks that this is clearly impossible to imagine. Instead, he argues that we need many more than four
elements. For each ordinary substance we hope to explain, we need some basic
element from which it can be made. Accordingly, Anaxagoras posits an infinite
number of elements. He calls these elements ‘seeds’. In contrast to the atoms, these are infinitely divisible, and they are in everything within the universe. This means
that, within everything, there is at least a little bit of everything else. This allows, for
instance, cheese to help in healing because it contains, within itself, a tiny bit of flesh,
which the body uses to patch up our wounds. Thus, there are no changes in substance, but only in proportion. In our example, earth isn’t turned into cheese and
then back into earth and then into flesh. Rather, the fleshy seeds simply moved from
the cheese to the flesh. Where Empedocles must explain a difference in character,
Anaxagoras requires only a difference in spatial position.
 
Empedocles’ defenders, however, might see Anaxagoras’ account as lacking in its own right. Empedocles’ account was thought to be deficient because it didn’t
explain how changes in the character of substances were possible; how earth became
flesh. Instead, Anaxagoras still needs to explain why the motion of the seeds happens
at all, and in the way it does. Why does the flesh move from the cheese to the wound? Empedocles had posited love and hate as fundamental forces of movement and a
better understanding of them would give us an account of why and how the
elements mixed. Anaxagoras, meanwhile, was impressed by the apparent order of the
universe. It didn’t seem to him that unconscious forces could be responsible for the diversity and harmony of things around us. We might, by contrast, expect the objects
created by unintelligent love and hate to be highly unstable and chaotic. Instead,
Anaxagoras looks at things like the heavenly bodies and sees law and order. This
 
97 observation leads him to conclude that movement issues from an intelligent ordering
principle. On this account, we have totally inert seeds which provide the matter of
the universe, and a supreme intelligence which manipulates the movements of those
elements in order to produce the world. Anaxagoras calls this intelligent principle
‘nous’, or reason, which stands as the only moving thing, moving itself and the seeds to form the universe.
 
Anaxagoras’ model of the universe represents the first time in Greek
philosophy that the rational life of the mind is divorced from the physical universe.
However, it is not just that these things are separated. Rather, the physical matter is, here, subordinated to mental processes which are characterized according to some
rational purpose. The physical world is the way that it is because it accords with one
single and rational plan. Attempts such as this, to explain natural phenomena in
terms of their purpose, are said to be a matter of teleology, and those explanations
are said to be teleological.24 Teleological explanations have, ever since, been in
contest with merely mechanical theories of scientific phenomena. The question
which philosophers must now grapple with is whether the world is governed by
natural laws which are incidental or whether there is a greater intelligence at work in the world. Interestingly, despite representing the first step in the direction of a
distinction between the mindless physical matter and the rational consciousness
which drives it, Anaxagoras still follows Empedocles in thinking that this moving
principle must also occupy some space in order to be real. He argues that the nous must be very fine and highly mobile seeds.
 
As mentioned before, Socrates is known to have read the work of
Anaxagoras, and he apparently found it wanting. Socrates had hoped that
Anaxagoras would provide a truly teleological explanation of the world but thought
he had fallen short. Nous, after all, still occupied space, and we were no closer to understanding the purpose of the world which nous acted so as to realize. Despite
failing to impress Socrates, later philosophers like Aristotle would take up the
division and subordination between the physical world and mind and develop
genuinely teleological explanations. These accounts will tell us that, not only is there
 
24 Teleology will be discussed further throughout the text, but especially in the “Plato” and “Aristotle” chapters. 
 
98 a purpose to the movements of physical bodies, but they will also tell us what that
purpose is.
 
The Pythagoreans 
 
The Pythagorean school was founded, as its name would suggest, by
Pythagoras, a native of Samos (an island off the Ionian coast). Stories of
Pythagoras’ life abound and, while no one seems to agree where he traveled to, ancient historians seem to agree that he traveled widely and used his travels as an
opportunity to study. On some accounts, he ventures to Persia and Egypt to study
math, on others he goes to India to study philosophy. Others, still, claim that he
studied under Jewish scholars in the Middle East and under Celtic scholars on the islands of the North Atlantic. Even if we can’t say where he traveled exactly, it is clear
that he did a good amount of it and was familiar with the math and philosophy of his
time. For many, his name is associated with mathematics because of the Pythagorean
theorem. However, while it was known to his followers and Pythagoras certainly had an interest in mathematics, as mentioned above, the theorem itself is now believed to
have been in use in Babylonia at least 1,000 years before Pythagoras’ time.
 
Beyond his travels and interest in math, we can also say that he eventually
settled in Crotone on the coast of southern Italy. There he founded what we have called a school of philosophy, but which might be just as easily understood as a
religious order. Here, members of the school were instructed to follow certain ethical
teachings, which were apparently as important to them as their scientific and
mathematical doctrines. According to some historical accounts, however, these
ethical teachings were not the product of Pythagoras himself, but of other early Pythagoreans. In this case, Pythagoras is believed to have been heavily influenced by
a philosopher and priestess of Delphi named Themistoclea (sometimes rendered
Aristoclea), who was apparently responsible for his moral and aesthetic theories
(though none of her own works have survived). The moral doctrines that are ascribed to the school include that adherents should avoid beans, roll their clothes up
after wearing them, and avoid touching white hens. In addition, members were
 
99 expected to not eat the hearts of animals, not look into mirrors under certain
conditions, avoid wool, and to not stir fire with iron. In any case, these measures
made up a large part of the Pythagoreans’ ascetic practice. Asceticism, here, refers to
sometimes extreme practices of self-denial and self-discipline for philosophical
reasons.25 
 
We have said that the Pythagorean school was as much a religious order as it
was a philosophical school. This is, in part, because of the stories and powers which
have been attributed to him. Pythagoras is said to have been able to talk to animals,
convincing a bull not to eat beans and convincing a bear to promise to commit no further harm to living creatures (a promise it apparently kept). We are also told that
he was able to predict a number of future events and that he so mastered his
involuntary impulses that he no longer engaged in laughter. However, despite the
religiosity and seemingly strange ethical doctrines, the school was also unique in its time for its tendency to allow women as students. This makes sense given
Themistoclea’s apparent role in Pythagoras’ own intellectual development. In this
way, the Pythagorean school is notable in its time for the great many women
philosophers it could claim, including Theano (who is thought to have written on
virtue and on the principle of the universe) and Aesara (who argued that a careful study of human nature will provide us with a model for morality and just
governance).26 Others still, including Arignote, Myia, and Damo, are known to us,
but little to nothing is known of what they thought.
 
While the school also apparently had a number of political and social ambitions, gaining an outsized political influence in Italy, its philosophical doctrines
are why it is most remembered. In this regard, Pythagoras is attributed with
advocating for and teaching a number of theories. Among these is the doctrine of 
the three lives. Here, Pythagoras tells us that the human soul consists in 1) reason, 2) intuition, and 3) mind. While our capacity for reason and intuition are seated in
 
25 Asceticism was also very popular among figures in the sramana movement of ancient India (such as those in the Ājīvika, Jain, and Buddhist schools) and among later mystical traditions within Islam and Christianity. 
26 This Theano is sometimes referred to as Theano of Crotona, so as to avoid confusion with another ancient Pythagorean, who is referred to as Theano II. Theano II is known to have written on ethical obligations in marriage and on the nature of love.  
 
100 the brain, our mind is, for Pythagoras, located in the heart. Another belief attributed
to Pythagoras is the doctrine of reincarnation, which we have already encountered in
ancient Indian philosophy. This belief would have been comparatively rare in Greek
society at the time. It was strange enough that later philosophers like Xenophanes joked that Pythagoras once attempted to stop a person from beating a dog because he
could recognize the voice of a dead friend in the dog’s howls. Likewise, Empedocles
seems to be referring to him when he talks about someone who could remember
what had happened ten or twenty generations back. Most interestingly, Pythagoras’
version of the doctrine of rebirth entails the view that the mind is distinguishable in substance from the physical body. If you can be reborn in another body, then there
is no sense in which you are that body. Accordingly, the doctrine gets strongly
associated with dualism in this tradition.
 
When it comes to answering the problem of the one and the many, Pythagoras and his followers contrast themselves with the more scientific account of
the universe offered by the Milesians. Their view is often and best summed up in the
statement that the underlying principle of the universe is number. We can call this
the doctrine of number. Interpretations of this doctrine vary. Theano argued that this merely meant that the world is, at bottom, describable according to
mathematics, and that Pythagoras merely meant that this relationship to math is the
source of the world’s intelligibility to reason. Others interpret Pythagoras as saying
that numbers themselves form the building blocks of the world (a view which might have inspired Plato to argue that everything is composed out of triangles). These later
interpretations might strike us as strange. For instance, it seems hard to imagine how
one might make something like a tree out of 4’s and 5’s. However, another
interpretation might be more familiar to us in the present day. We are relatively close,
in our own time, to making something like a passable reality out of a computer simulation. Such a simulation would itself be, at bottom, composed of the 1’s and
0’s which form the binary code. In this way, the closest thing we have done to
creating our own reality would be something made out of numbers. Is it that
implausible that our own is constructed in a similar way? Of course, our simulations have some physical computer supporting them, so we might wonder what fulfills the
same function on Pythagoras’ account. Here, a common ancient interpretation is
that Pythagoras holds that the universe is the result of bringing together ‘the
 
101 unlimited’ (infinite empty space) and ‘the limited’ (the unlimited’s opposite, which
gives distinct character to particular things). Our world takes on characteristics of
both these. Objects in our universe are spatial in their nature, but they are limited in
space. The Pythagoreans are thought to have associated the unlimited and limited with even and odd numbers respectively. Given this association, the universe can be
composed of particular proportions between numbers which are harmonious and
allow for order.
 
Later Pythagoreans would take this basic model of the universe and attempt
to develop scientific explanations for events and things in the world. They see a deep and fundamental connection between mathematics, music, and the world. Math is
the basis of our reality, and it is also the basis of our music. Pythagoras is said to have
discovered mathematical relationships between musical notes by noticing the
different sizes of anvils which produced different sounds when struck by a hammer. The different notes reflected different sizes and the sizes which formed clean and
beautiful mathematical proportions also produced beautiful music. This apparently
led him to conclude that, since the world is constructed on the basis of harmony
between numbers, then the movements of the planets and the stars are undertaken
on the basis of musical harmony. This idea became known as the harmony of the 
spheres. Beyond this, mathematical harmonies formed the basis of every Pythagorean explanation. They associated men with odd numbers, women with
even numbers, and marriage with the number five (because it brought together the odd and even). Despite these efforts lacking any clear explanatory success, Pythagoras
and his followers are still among the first to have taken seriously the idea that we
could explain the world according to mathematical principles, and this idea forms
the basis of modern physics. However, another school in this time period will
quickly tread even closer to the worldview revealed by modern physics: the atomists.
 
The Atomists 
 
The pluralists’ impulse to appeal to small, unseen, fundamental things as an
explanation for the universe took a different turn in the works of Leucippus and his
 
102 student Democritus. These two thinkers are central to the introduction of atomism,
as a philosophical position, to Greek philosophy. Like many of the figures we have so
far discussed, we know very little about the life of Leucippus. Further, his work
seems to have been incorporated into the texts of Democritus to such a large degree that we have trouble now saying whose ideas were whose. Theophrastus, a student of
Aristotle’s and a philosopher in his own right, was not able to deduce whether
Leucippus was from Miletus or Elea but speculated that it was one of the two.
Despite the mysterious circumstances of his life, we do know a bit about his
philosophical project. Parmenides had argued that there was only one infinite principle of the universe, which was just pure undifferentiated being. Empedocles
and Anaxagoras argued, instead, there are a number of differentiated substances at
the bottom of reality. Leucippus takes what he sees as best about both ideas and
combines them to make his own view. Here, like Parmenides, Leucippus tells us that the principle of the universe is undifferentiated, but like the pluralists, it is numerous
rather than unified. Thus, he arrived at the view that there were an infinite number
of simple beings which reality is composed of. He called these things atoms. These
atoms move around and combine to form the objects of our world. However, movement is a thorny issue for the Presocratics. Parmenides had been led to deny
motion because it meant that there was empty space for things to move into, and
because empty space could not exist. Leucippus runs that same argument backwards.
Since we know that movement is real (through our observation of it), there must be some empty space which things move into. This leaves Leucippus with only atoms
and void at the foundations of reality. This makes him the first of the Greeks to
explicitly affirm the existence of empty space.
 
It is easy for us, in the modern day, to point at the Greek atomists and the
atomists of the Indian Vaisheshika school and think that they were far ahead of their time. Indeed, the atomic view that these schools propose is strikingly similar to that
of modern science, and many philosophers are led to conclude that both models lead
to the same implications in ethics and metaphysics. However, Leucippus’ atomism is
also still very different from our modern account of the atoms. For one, the atoms are indivisible. This allows the atomists to avoid an infinite regress problem when
answering the problem of the one and the many. Beyond this though, the atoms are
said to differ in shape and shape alone. The different objects of reality at our level are
 
103 amalgamations of atoms which are of a like shape. Finally, while the atoms in our
part of the universe are too small to be seen, Greek atomists speculate that there
could be massive atoms elsewhere in the universe. These atoms might be so large that
they are visible to the naked eye. However, in our neck of the woods, atoms are small, and the large one’s clump together and form the solid earth, while the tiniest ones
form the thin air and fiery heavens. Thus, while Leucippus’ account is not entirely in
line with our current science, it does represent the emergence of atomism as a
popular answer to the problem of the one and the many in Greek thought in much
the same way that Vaisheshika does in ancient Indian philosophy.
 
Leucippus’ atomism functions in Greek thought the way that Vaisheshika
does in Indian philosophy in at least one other way; it gives us the first wholehearted
endorsement of materialism within the tradition. Likewise, it reduced differences in
the nature of things to differences in the quantity and concentration of atoms. Thus, like Pythagoreanism, it saw math as providing us with the ability to understand the
world. However, unlike Pythagoreanism, this math was useful on a scientific and
physical level. The mathematics which describes natural movement and quantities
could provide us with a mechanical explanation for natural phenomena which was free of teleology. The world of only atoms and void is indifferent to purpose and is in
no need of a nous to guide it. Observation of the world and its component parts
provides us with all of the information we need to understand it. Further, not only
did the physical world not require mind, but mind also itself is reducible to the physics of atoms. The mind, like the heavens, is simply composed of the finest and
most active atoms. Understanding the mind is, accordingly, merely a matter of
understanding the motion of such atoms. Sensation and perception emerge from the
bringing together of fine atoms and consciousness emerges from that. Thus, one’s
consciousness ceases when the body is destroyed. A radically different picture than Pythagoras’ doctrine of reincarnation.
 
While Leucippus is remembered as the originator of Greek atomism,
Democritus is better known for working out the fuller account of the view and
what it entails. He was born to rich parents in Abdera (yet another Greek Ionian colony). He is known to have traveled extensively, and to have drawn together the
knowledge he collected in works which now only survive to us in fragments. This is,
in part, because Democritus wrote and worked in Abdera, and works were mostly
 
104 read and copied in Athens at the time of his life. Beyond this, he was also only a
Presocratic in the philosophical sense. He is thought to have been born around the
time of Socrates and to have lived for roughly as long. Likewise, when it comes to his
contributions as a philosopher, he might just as easily be classified with Aristotle and Plato. He wrote on many topics and unified his accounts of those topics in a
systematic way. Where the earlier Presocratics offer us only theories on isolated
questions, Democritus gives us a proper and somewhat complete account of reality.
While taking on board the atomistic metaphysics of Leucippus, Democritus expands
on this by rooting its justification in an account of knowledge. Likewise, he also dwells on the implications of the atomic model. Without a need for a nous governing
over reality, something else must explain the order of the world, and this explanation
matters to how our lives unfold. These are the considerations that Democritus is
sensitive to.
 
Democritus recognized that the atomistic theory of Leucippus suffered
from the same problem that pluralists like Empedocles and Anaxagoras were dealing
with. Namely, it is one thing to say that the objects of the world are made up of
smaller bits of some more fundamental elements, but on account of what? Empedocles and Anaxagoras posited the forces of love and hate and the intelligence
of nous respectively in order to set the elements in motion. The question that
remained for the atomists was one of why the elements combined at all. Democritus
sought an explanation that would appeal to the material particles themselves, and not lie in some external force like love, hate, or disembodied mind itself. The atoms
behave the way they do because it accords with some fully determined natural law.
That is, the atoms are in motion because they must be, and they must be in motion
in this way. Unlike Anaxagoras, then, neither the movements of the stars nor the
organization of our bodies permits of a supreme plan. Instead, events are merely the result of brute laws which must be the way they are, and which fix all future events.
This opposition, between teleological explanations appealing to divine plans and a
cold and indifferent atomic theory, sets up the work of later atomists. These thinkers
focus their efforts on writing polemics against contemporary religion, and instead advocating for atheism and materialism.
 
Beyond providing a mechanical account of the movement of the atoms, it is
likely that Democritus is the author of the atomist account of perception and
 
105 knowledge. Here, Democritus explains perception according to the theory of 
images. According to this theory, the objects we see out in the world shed tiny copies, or images, of themselves. These replicas then enter our eyes and ears, which
are capable of receiving and recognizing them. This sets the atoms of the soul in motion, and this gives rise to perceptions. This theory can also explain the difference
between true and false knowledge. High quality copies of objects are fine and pass
gently through the perceptual organs. This causes a gentle motion in the soul which
leads to knowledge. By contrast, rough and coarse copies of objects disturb the soul,
which results in confused perceptions. These confused sensations are mere appearances while the gentle motions of the soul are genuine knowledge. While this
theory still certainly leaves a lot to be explained, it does represent a much more
scientific account of knowledge. Likewise, it is systematic in that it unifies a
metaphysical theory with its ethical and epistemological implications. Thus, from Thales to Democritus, we have a steady march towards more reasoned and scientific
ways of thinking in Greece. Not only were the gods no longer offered as the solution
to questions about the fundamental nature of reality, but philosophers were also
now sensitive to better and worse explanations, and those explanations having consequences that matter for those that believe them.

109
Socrates 
 
Unlike those we have so far discussed, Socrates was born in Athens, and he
is largely responsible for its eventual and enduring association with philosophy. At
an early age, he began to study sculpting under the training of his father who was, himself, a sculptor. While he was apparently fairly proficient in this occupation,
Socrates soon gave it up and chose, instead, to focus on philosophy. As mentioned in
our discussion of the Presocratics, Socrates is known to have at least read the work of
Anaxagoras, and he was possibly a student of Diotima of Mantinea (the woman who is said to have originated the concept of Platonic love). As a philosopher, he lived
frugally, owning no shoes and only a single cloak which he wore throughout the
year. Rather than writing, he spent his time in the marketplace, seeking out anyone
who would discuss the questions he found especially interesting and important (and especially those who were regarded to be experts on these topics). By his own
admission, he would ‘pour himself out’ to anyone who would listen and, if there
were none willing, he might even pay for someone to listen to him.
 
Despite his willingness to joke at his own expense, Socrates’ habits of
interrogating people about philosophical questions was the result of a genuine and serious philosophical project.  He had heard that the Oracle at Delphi pronounced
that there was no one alive wiser than him. While we might think this would be great
news to find out, as it would certainly look good on your resume, further reflection
reveals it to be quite distressing. After all, Socrates is fairly intelligent, but he is a sculptor by trade. To find out that he is the wisest man in the world is to find out
that the politicians and important people of society, the ones who are making
decisions about almost everything, know less than him. After all, wouldn’t you find
it distressing to learn that the people responsible for your healthcare and for managing the nation’s nuclear weapons arsenal are less informed than you?
 
111
Unable to understand how this could be the case (and presumably hoping
that it is not), Socrates set about to find the wisest people and test the claim.
However, every time he spoke to a self-styled expert, Socrates found that there was
only ignorance behind their overconfident answers. No one seemed to know anything about justice, beauty, love, wisdom, truth, or goodness. Eventually, the true
meaning of the Oracle’s claim presented itself to him. Socrates was the wisest person
alive because his ignorance was apparent to him, whereas everyone else thought that
they were wise. He is wise because he knows nothing. On the basis of this, Socrates
concluded that the gods provided him with the mission of pointing out the ignorance of those around him so that they could begin the journey towards genuine
knowledge. In short, his calling was to bother Athens, and he was apparently quite
successful in this effort. He eventually earned the title of “Gadfly of Athens” because
he, like a fly, buzzed around in people’s faces.
 
It is no surprise that this tendency brought about as many (or more)
enemies as it did friends. Socrates was on a mission from the gods, and he had no
time to preserve the feelings of those he publicly embarrassed. He drew suspicion
and ridicule from those in power and, eventually, was accused of denying the gods themselves and of corrupting the youth of Athens through the example he set. These
charges were eventually brought to trial. This trail and its aftermath would define his
legacy.
 
What we know of Socrates’ views and philosophical method we know from
the writings of his students, as he is not known to have produced written work of his own. Chief among these accounts are the works of Socrates’ student Plato. While
Plato does use Socrates as a character in some dialogues, in order to argue for his own
views, we have good reason to think that the dialogues concerning Socrates’ trial and
the circumstances of his death are accurate to the events of his life. One interesting thing that we see in examining these dialogues is that, unlike many of those we have
already discussed, Socrates is more remembered for the spirit by which he
approached philosophy rather than the particular doctrines he proposed. In this case,
his impact on philosophy was, at least, threefold.
 
First, Socrates pioneered the practice of giving and asking for accounts of
the nature of things and offering challenges to those accounts in the form of
 
112 counterexamples. Socrates uses this Socratic method to explore a wide variety of topics, ranging from the nature of piety and the soul to the good life and political
obligation. Further, Socrates’ method is interpersonal; he engages in Socratic 
dialogue. He seeks out a wise person, he lets them tell him their theories and, in response, he doesn’t typically argue for theories of his own. Instead, he merely asks
critical questions until his interlocutor ultimately reveals to themselves that they
don’t actually know what they claim to know. Finally, these dialogues are dripping in
what has come to be known as ‘Socratic irony’. As we have already said, Socrates
does not really believe that the people he talks to have the expertise they contend they have. However, Socrates always acts as if he believes this, usually flattering the person
he is talking to and lulling them into a false sense of confidence, playing dumb about
his own intentions in the conversation.
 
Socrates’ second contribution is evident lurking just behind his famous
statement that, “the unexamined life is not worth living.”27 This emphasis, on using
the rational tools of philosophy to clarify how we ought to live, represents another
profound influence Socrates had on the history of philosophy. While he wasn’t the
first philosopher in the world to offer a theory of the good life, his concern for the question did elevate its status within Greek philosophy to being on par with the
metaphysical and epistemological questions that concerned the presocratics.
Socrates, more than any other philosopher in the greater mediterranean
philosophical tradition, is responsible for pressing the issue of goodness, whether personal or political until it would finally establish itself as a core part of the
tradition.
 
Finally, Socrates brought philosophy down to the level of the everyday.
Natural philosophy dealt in abstract topics. The average person doesn’t concern
themselves with the ultimate principle of reality or with whether change is really possible. Socrates was, instead, concerned with topics that regular folks also
considered important (e.g., justice, morality, knowledge, and the afterlife), and he
did philosophy by talking to regular people in a public space. He has taken
philosophy down from Thales’ tower where his head remains in the cloud and

113 brought it into the crowded marketplace. Indeed this is where our scene begins, as
Socrates is preparing for his trial.
 
Ethical Philosophy 
 
Before he can make it inside the courthouse, we are told that Socrates runs
into his friend Euthyphro, who is there prosecuting his father. Socrates is,
understandably, taken aback by the idea of a son prosecuting their own parent, and he points out that Euthyphro must be very confident in his own moral compass if he
is willing to break up his own family over his father’s actions. Euthyphro tells him
that his father had killed a servant who, in turn, had killed a slave in a drunken attack.
When Euthyphro’s father finds out about this, he apprehends the servant and leaves him tied up in a ditch while he fetches the authorities. Unfortunately for the servant,
the mountainous terrain of Greece makes travel slow and, as day passes to night, the
cold sets in and the servant dies of (seemingly negligent) exposure. This is why
Euthyphro is prosecuting his father. Having this all explained to him, Socrates asks Euthyphro about the nature of piety (or we might call ‘morality’). What does
goodness consist in? Surely Euthyphro must know this if he knows that his father
did wrong. Euthyphro first attempts to just list a series of good things (like helping
old ladies cross the street and saving kittens stuck in trees). However, Socrates points out that Euthyphro has merely provided him with a list of good things, not given
him an account of the essential nature of goodness. Socrates wants, on some level,
the right definition of morality so that he can use to defend himself in his own trial.
It’s one thing to know a list of good and bad things, but, after all, that won’t help us when we run into something we haven’t encountered before and we’re trying to
figure out how to handle the situation morally.
 
Eventually, Euthyphro is pushed to provide a version of what has come to
be known as divine command theory. This is the view that, on some level, what is
morally right is just what God commands. Good and bad behavior are decided by God because God is the author of moral law. God, we’re told, is the only person
properly positioned to have the authority to write objective standards of behavior.
 
114
This view is ancient, but it has remained quite popular throughout history. Of
course, Euthyphro is living in ancient Greece and, as such, believes there are a
number of gods. Accordingly, Euthyphro’s version of divine command theory tells
us that ‘what is pious is that which is loved by the gods’. This pushes Socrates to point out that the gods often disagree with one another. Sometimes the gods take
opposing sides of the same war. What is the right thing to do in these cases, where the
gods seem to love different things? Euthyphro is seemingly stumped at this question,
but Socrates bails him out by suggesting that he might answer that piety is what the
gods agree on. Euthyphro jumps at this answer. There may be matters where the gods disagree and, as such, moral matters are undecided, but there are also areas of
significant agreement. The gods agree that murder, theft, and puppy torture are bad
and that helping those in need is good, so we can be confident that this theory will
give us the right answers.
 
However, this only raises another question for Socrates. Euthyphro has told
him that the pious is that which is loved by the gods, but Socrates wants to know
why that is the case. As he sees it, there are two possible answers to this, both of
which lead to some consequences we might want to avoid. This situation, in which one must choose between two bad alternatives, can be called a ‘dilemma’ (literally
meaning ‘two horns’). In asking this question, Socrates has set a philosophical bull
loose on Euthyphro, and Euthyphro must decide which of the horns he wants to
dodge and which he wants to sit there and take. If this is a true dilemma, then all that is left for Euthyphro to do is to decide which answer to the question is the least
painful intellectually. Socrates offers both answers. Either 1) what is pious is pious
because it is loved by the gods or 2) the gods love what is pious because it is pious.
This problem has come to be known as the Euthyphro dilemma. We can take these
two horns in turn.
 
If Euthyphro asserts that what is pious is pious because it is loved by the
gods, then divine command theory is preserved. We need God to tell us what is right
and what is wrong because in deciding these matters god makes it so that murder is
wrong and kindness is good. For this reason, it is an attractive answer. The problem is that it renders morality arbitrary on some level. If that is the entirety of the story of
why murder is bad, because god says so, then it seems we are condemned to say that
God hates murder the way that you hate raisins in a salad and God loves compassion
 
115 the way you have a taste for chocolate ice cream. Divine command theory is simple,
that’s one of its attractions. If God says ‘jump’ we are supposed to say, ‘how high?’
However, this also means that if God tells Abraham “kill me a son”, Abraham better
start sharpening his knife. By the same token, if God were to part the sky, stick his head down through the clouds, and announce that purge night was commencing
and that humans are now morally required to murder one another in the street, then
we have no recourse to have to our own view about things. Strictly speaking, it
would be us that are in the wrong. Further, without rational basis for what he loves,
we have no reason to think that God’s distaste for torture will not, at any moment, give way to an acquired taste for it.
 
On the other hand, if Euthyphro answers that what is pious is loved by the
gods because it is pious, then it must be pious for its own independent reasons,
which the gods are wise to recognize. This closes off the possibility of God arbitrarily instigating a holy purge night because God wouldn’t do such a thing. God doesn’t
just happen to not like torture and murder. God dislikes these things because they
hurt people, because they violate people’s rights, or for some other reason. While this
has the benefit of avoiding morality being arbitrary (and therefor allowing us to object to God potentially changing his mind about the moral laws of the universe), it
also comes with some consequences. Namely, it renders God’s presence in our
account of morality unnecessary. If God hates murder because it makes people
suffer, then we can simply bypass God altogether and say that what is good is what alleviates suffering and what is bad is what causes it. If God has reasons for liking
what he does, then we can appeal directly to those reasons ourselves. This seems to
make divine command theory obsolete.
 
Upon facing down this bull, Euthyphro is profoundly stumped. He chooses
the second horn and sets out to explain what it is that the gods rightfully recognize in the good that makes it so good, but he comes no closer to providing an account of
this than he had so far. However, this dialogue is not remembered for Euthyphro’s
satisfying answer or the lack thereof. The lasting legacy of the dialogue is found in
the fact that many other philosophers have sought to either defend the first horn or pursue the ultimate answer to the second. This latter project, of identifying what it is
that makes the good good, is the essence of moral philosophy. As such, it is a project
which will remain with us for some time.
 
116
The Good Life 
 
Having finished his discussion with Euthyphro, Socrates is finally called
into his trial. As we have already said, he stands accused of impiety and of corrupting
the youth. The person bringing these charges against him is the poet Meletus. But
before we can get into Socrates defense against these claims, there is more that can be
said which will help in providing context to Socrates’ ideas and arguments.
Importantly, we must discuss the Sophist school in ancient Athens. These are philosophers who were less concerned with arriving at an account of the truth of the
universe and more concerned with using the skill set of philosophy in rhetoric.
Among them were figures like Gorgias (who argued that being able to convince others that we have knowledge is more important than actually having it) and
Thrasymachus (who argued that might makes right). The sophists were skeptical
about argumentation ever getting at an objective truth and tended to think of it,
instead, as a weapon which could be wielded to defend oneself or get one’s way. These skills might be used in political speeches or in trials, and the most famous
sophists would teach others to excel in these domains regardless of what their
students believed or were trying to accomplish. Accordingly, sophists were
considered something of a public nuisance in Athens and many regular people on the street might consider all philosophers sophists. By contrast, since most
philosophers take themselves to be concerned with the truth, they tend to try and
put distance between themselves and the sophists (and might actually resent them
more than the public). The dispute between the sophists and their truth-concerned rivals animates much of what happens around the trial of Socrates, as does the
public’s willingness to lump both parties in together. Socrates is troubled by the
sophists and resists any implication that he is one.
 
Socrates begins his defense by tackling the first of the two claims, that he is
impious. Typically, as we have seen with Anaxagoras (who Socrates read and who Diotima may have read), the charge of impiety amounts to the denial of the gods.
However, Socrates points out that he cannot be accused of denying the gods. After
all, he is on a mission from the gods. Unlike the sophists, Socrates is not a public
nuisance for money or for its own sake. Socrates never charged a fee to teach his students. They merely gathered around him and were taken to learning from him.
 
117
Meanwhile, he is, in his own estimation, a humble servant of the gods providing an
essential service to Athens. Namely, it is helping the people of the city realize their
own profound ignorance. As they often say, the first step is usually accepting that
you have a problem, and Socrates wants the city of Athens to recognize that they are not wise so that they too can seek out wisdom in the way that he has. We can call this
many things. It might be patronizing, arrogant, or deluded, but Socrates is, on some
level, motivated by his belief in the gods, not his denial of them.
 
Having taken himself to have fully addressed the first charge, Socrates can
now begin his defense against the second. Here, the claim is that Socrates’ continued harassment of the most important and powerful people of the city has been a
negative influence on the children of Athens. To be clear, Socrates did have a
profound influence on a number of wealthy young men in Athens, Plato included.
While lower class boys and the girls of the city did not have a significant amount of leisure time to exercise, wealthy young boys would often gather in the park to watch
as Socrates embarrassed major figures of their society. To these young boys, many of
Socrates’ interlocutors are their fathers’ friends, the most powerful and authoritative
people in the city. What could be more rebellious and entertaining to an audience of teenagers than watching a disheveled, seemingly homeless, older man making all of
these people look foolish. No one was free from Socrates’ powers to embarrass. He
spoke to politicians, generals, and artists alike, seeking out wisdom and finding them
all wanting. Socrates had high hopes for the artists, since art seems to get at profound truths, but he discovered that artists know little about their work or their own
process. Often, they are simply subject to a spark of inspiration. If this is right, then it
is only luck that decides whether the artist says something true or not, and this would
presumably include the poet Meletus. Now we can understand something of the
background politics at play in Socrates’ trial. Figures like this have lost the respect of and authority over their wayward teenage sons and now many of these boys have
taken to imitating Socrates themselves, harassing and questioning their fathers. In
turn, they have supported Meletus in bringing these charges to finally put an end to
Socrates’ influence. In response, Socrates says that he did not tell any of these boys to do as he did, they merely decided for themselves to imitate them. With that, Socrates
rests his case and the jury must deliberate. They return with an answer: guilty.
 
118
Now having been found guilty, Socrates must be sentenced. An Athenian
trial in this time period would, upon a guilty verdict, allow both sides to argue for a
suggested punishment. Since the jury must choose one of the two punishments
presented, the prosecution and the defense are highly incentivized toward moderation. If, for instance, the prosecution suggests something far too extreme,
then the jury is forced to go with the defense’s punishment, and defense can use that
to their advantage. The same is true for the defense suggesting something too lenient.
For perspective, impiety is a serious offense in this time. Death might not be off the
table but exile would be more common, especially for a citizen of Athens as Socrates is. Socrates considers suggesting exile on his own behalf, but he recognizes that he
could not do philosophy outside of Athens. Sure, he could go and live in Sparta, but
the Spartans would have no patience for Socrates’ antics. Thus, to accept exile is to
accept the end of philosophizing, an idea that Socrates can’t stomach. This is what compels him to declare that the unexamined life is not worth living. He would rather
accept his own death than deny himself the mission that the gods and the oracle have
set him on.
 
What, then, is left for Socrates? He throws out two possible punishments. First, he argues that he has performed an amusing service for the city. While he takes
himself to be leading its inhabitants to wisdom and virtue, if nothing else, many have
enjoyed watching him work. In this way, he is not too different from a racehorse. As
such, Socrates argues that he should be treated like a racehorse. That is, a just punishment might be to provide him with free food and shelter as we do for
racehorses. It is unclear the extent to which this is a serious suggestion. In some ways,
we are left to wonder whether Socrates takes this trial seriously at all and, if not,
when he decided to use it simply to amuse himself rather than to try to save his own
life. Instead, recognizing that the jury will not go for this, Socrates concludes that he should be charged a small fine. The fine, in this case, should be small because he
doesn’t have much money to take. After all, he lives on a rather shoestring budget
and bothering people at the park is not known as an especially lucrative career. This,
in effect, seals Socrates’ fate. The jury will not tolerate such a minor punishment for such a significant crime. They accept Meletus’ punishment: death.
 
Now, in the closing moments of his trial, Socrates is permitted to make his
final public comments before being taken to prison to await his sentence. Socrates
 
119 tells the audience that he does not fear death because, as he sees it, one of two things
must happen when we die. First, it’s possible that our souls are immortal and live on
long after we exit our earthly vessels. If this is the case, then Socrates, in death, is free
to travel the cosmos in pursuit of wisdom and truth. No longer shackled to the here and now, Socrates could consult with those who came before him. Socrates could
seek out Thales, Pythagoras, and the mathematicians of Egypt and Babylon. He sees
this possibility as inspiring and optimistic. In fact, it is, in essence, to live the good
examined life on a much grander and more glorious scale. On the other hand,
however, it may be that death really is an end, that our souls are simply blown out like a match as we fall gently into the great big nothingness in the sky; the eternal
sleep of annihilationism. Surely such an outcome isn’t as exciting to Socrates as the
other, but, nevertheless, an eternal dreamless sleep is certainly not bad. If there is
nothing after life then there is no one for whom nothingness could be bad. With that, Socrates says that he will now go to die and the jury will now go to live, and
only the gods know which is better.
 
Political Philosophy 
 
In jail and awaiting his execution, Socrates is visited by his friend and
student Crito. Crito arrives quickly and announces to Socrates that he has come to help him escape from prison. The guard has been paid off and a boat is ready to take
Socrates out of Athens. However, rather than sigh a sigh of relief and rush to
freedom as we might expect, Socrates does something characteristically Socratic and
questions Crito about whether it really would be just for him to evade his punishment. Now dragged into a philosophical conversation in the middle of a
prison break, Crito must defend the idea that Socrate ought to escape.
 
Crito throws out a number of arguments here. He tells Socrates that he is
giving his enemies what they want by staying and that others will think poorly of
Crito and his fellow students if they are not good enough friends to help Socrates escape. Socrates responds by arguing that Crito should not care what ‘others will
think’. Instead, he should care only about what wise people will think, and the best
 
120 way to know what wise people will think is to find out if he has good independent
reason to escape at all. The same is true for giving his enemies what they want.
Socrates is not concerned with what they want or think. He is only interested in
what he ought to think. That is, what he has rational reason to believe and to want. Now, Socrates asks Crito, why would it be just for him to escape his punishment?
 
Here, Crito tries to tug at Socrates’ heartstrings. He reminds him that
Socrates is a father. He has sons and if he were to be executed, who would take care
of his sons and educate them in virtue? Socrates is very aware of his children though.
In fact, In closing his final comments at his trial, Socrates tells the jury to bother his sons the way that he has bothered the people of Athens if they find out that Socrates’
sons value riches or fame above virtue and wisdom. The moral and philosophical
education of his sons is paramount on Socrates’ mind. It is for this very reason, he
says, that he must stay and accept his punishment. After all, he passionately argued that the unexamined life is not worth living, and that he would willingly accept his
own death before he would accept a life without philosophy. What kind of example
would he be setting for his children if he were to turn around and flee for his life
once he is actually in a position to act on his words and beliefs. However, beyond merely being a hypocrite, Socrates really does believe that a life without philosophy
would be too impoverished to be worth living, and that a life of philosophy cannot
happen in any city he might flee to. This all seems to leave him right back where he
left off at the end of his trial.
 
Finally, with this, Socrates draws Crito into the heart of the issue. Crito argues, as his last recourse, that Socrates’ punishment is simply unjust. Socrates
should escape, if for no other reason than because he loves justice. These are, after all,
trumped up charges brought on by Socrates’ political enemies, and his punishment is
far too severe for what he actually did. This raises the problem of political 
obligation, the question of if, when, and why we are obligated to follow the law. We might have a rational obligation to follow the law. For instance, imagine you are
travelling down an empty two-lane road in the middle of the night. You are
surrounded by soybean fields on all sides for as far the eye can see. As such, you are very confident that if someone were around, you would see them. However, on this
night, there are no animals, cars, or people to be found for miles. It’s just you and the
road. Now, as you come upon a stop sign, you might still think you have reason to
 
121 stop. After all, what if you are wrong that there is no one around and a well-hidden
cop immediately pulls you over and gives you a ticket. In this case, it is in your
rational self-interest to obey the law. Further, you might think you have a moral
obligation to follow the law. This is just to say that you might be wrong that no one is around, and you might, in running the stop sign, accidentally hit a person, another
car, or a deer. Notice, though, that this is just to say that you are morally obligated to
stop at the stop sign and that the law happens to coincide with that. The problem of
political obligation, however, is the question of whether we have distinctly political
obligations. That is, whether we are obligated to follow the law even when it is not in our interest to do so and even when it is not independently morally obligated of us.
In fact, if we have such obligations, then we might have to follow the law even when
it actively is against our own self-interest and even when it may be otherwise
immoral, as may be the case for Socrates. Indeed, Socrates will argue that he has exactly this kind of obligation to follow the law, even when it unjustly sentences him
to death.
 
In defense of this claim, Socrates points out three facts which compel him to
follow the law. These are as follows:
 
1.   He benefitted from the laws of Athens.
2.   He could have left Athens if he didn’t like the laws but didn’t.
3. He could have tried to change the laws of Athens if he didn’t like them but 
didn’t.
 
Socrates has been clear through his trial; he does not think he could have
done philosophy anywhere but Athens. Given that he thinks that his life would
literally not be worth living if he wasn’t able to do this, Socrate was quite lucky to
have been born and lived in Athens. The same laws which now condemn him to death allowed him to live as he wished for a long and full life. By the same token, he
was quite aware of the laws against impiety. In his own time, he had seen Anaxagoras
tried for impiety in Athens. He had seen the same fate come to Aspasia (perhaps
Diotima of Mantinea) and Pericles (among others). If Socrates had really had a
problem with the law against impiety, he was empowered as an Athenian citizen to try to change them. Not only did he not use that opportunity, he also could have
easily left, but thought the trade off was worth it so that he could do philosophy.
 
122
Given all of this, Socrates sees himself as a party to an implicit agreement
with the government of Athens. The term ‘ social contract’ refers to real or imagined agreement between a government and its subject in which those subjects
agree to follow the law in exchange for various social benefits that come with having that government. Socrates has, in his own eyes, signed such a social contract. He
accepted the goods of this arrangement, running up the bill, and it would not be
right to try to skip out on the check now. Many later philosophers will appeal to
their own versions of the social contract in order to answer the problem of political
obligation. In this way, Socrates offers us one of the world’s first versions of social 
contract theory.
 
For what it’s worth, Crito finds himself convinced by the force of Socrates’
arguments and gives up on his pursuit of Socrates’ freedom. It seems that Socrates
will die. However, what should we, today, make of Socrates’ argument? There are at least two readings. On one interpretation, Socrates is offering a liberal argument. As
we have seen, ancient political regimes tended to justify themselves through force of
violence or by appealing to God’s approval. The result, in either case, is that the
citizen has no real rights. We might be lucky if we live under a wise and just ruler, but we have no rational philosophical basis for objecting to the way our government
treats us, we have only our own private personal preference for not being tortured to
death. What Socrates has offered us is an articulation of the circumstances under
which we could ignore or otherwise resist the government. While he did meet all of the criteria above, someone else might not. Such a person, on Socrates’ view, has no
real obligation to follow the law. For instnace, if a person did not get to enjoy any of
the benefits provided by the laws of their society, then they have no ties to its
government. In this way, the individual citizen has at least some rights. Namely, the
right to benefit from the laws they find themselves living under. This is, for its time, a very progressive view of government, and its ancestors will provide the intellectual
basis for the rebirth of democracy in Europe, Haiti, and the United States in a
thousand years.
 
On another reading, Socrates is offering us an authoritarian model of governance. While it appears progressive at first, think about what the actual
practical effects of his view are in his own life. Socrates must follow the law even
when it is otherwise unjust and even when it puts him to death. Regardless of
 
123 whether we think his guilty verdict, or his sentence is actually unjust, his model has
not allowed for someone to get out of the contract solely on the basis of it being
unjust. As long as they benefit, seemingly in some way, and do little to change it or
leave, they are obligated, and this obligation apparently runs all the way up to death.
 
However, there is also a third, less common, reading that we can offer of Socrates’ political philosophy. That is that Socrates is offering us something of a
tragic lament. Recall that he has seen many of his friends and teachers be brought up
on the exact same charges that he has now been found guilty of. Recall that he tells
us that he did nothing to change the laws, even after watching this unfold. On this view, it is not just that he could have but that he should have tried to change the laws,
and he must now pay the price of this decision. Socrates has tried to live an examined
life, like Anaxagoras and Diotima before him, but he is now being sentenced to death
on account of his philosophizing. Perhaps it turns out that the examined life cannot be lived in isolation. We may try to content ourselves with our own private desires
and our personal views about how we want to live. We may want a life free from
politics, but politics is not free of us. The political realm is more than willing to reach
its icy hand across and into the private sphere of our lives and the only guarantee of the possibility of an examined life for ourselves comes in working to ensure that it is
possible for all. It may be that Socrates invites us, in his final moments, to consider
whether we have tried to change the laws which might one day come for us too.
 
Metaphysics 
 
Finally, the day of Socrates’ execution is at hand. Many of his students and
friends have gathered to speak with him one final time and to hear his last words.
Indeed, a few of them are completely distraught that it has come to this. It is in this moment that Socrates finally reveals himself and puts his cards on the table. While he
had claimed during his trial that there were two plausible options for what might
happen after death, Socrates does, in fact, think that one of them is true. In
particular, Socrates does not believe that his death will be his end. Instead, he asserts
that we have immortal souls which will survive, and that this should give comfort to
 
124 his friends and students. Naturally, those around him are curious about Socrates’
reasoning since he appears to be unusually confident in his own beliefs here. In turn,
Socrates provides four arguments that this must be the case.
 
First among Socrates’ arguments is what we can call the cyclical argument.
Here Socrates points out that opposite states of being come from one another. If we want to make a pot of water hot, it must first be cold. If we wanted to make it cold, it
must first be hot. After all, we can’t make that which is hot hot. It’s already hot!
However, this is not just a fact about temperature. The same is true for being asleep
or awake. We must first be asleep to be awoken, and we must first be awake in order to fall asleep. The same, Socrates tells us, is true for life and death. Of course, it is
clear that we can only die if we are first alive. Death comes from life but, by the same
token, life comes from death. These states of being are inherently cyclical. This
means that we must have been alive prior to our birth and, accordingly, we must be alive after our death. This should strike us as somewhat similar to Pythagoras’
doctrine of reincarnation. However, unlike Pythagoras, Socrates does not think we
are reincarnated. That is, our life prior to birth was not in a material body; we were
not made from meat. In the same way, we will not have a material life after our death. This pushes Pythagoras’ dualism further. Where he saw individuals as
immaterial souls repeatedly made material, Socrates thinks that our being made
material is simply a one-off, and that our natural state of being is immaterial. This
difference will become important once Plato gets ahold of it.
 
Second is the recollection argument. In the same way that Socrates’ views about life before and after death are similar to Pythagoras’, the implications are
similar as well. Recall that Empedocles suggested that Pythagoras could remember
details from lives ten or twenty generations prior. If such a thing is possible, as
Socrates believes it is, then we must be alive prior to birth and thus death is not an end, as that live presumably ended in death as well. This might seem like a weak
argument, as it rests on the assumption that we can have knowledge from prior lives
(surely a controversial thesis at the least). However, Socrates has rather sophisticated
reasons for thinking this, which will become clear when we turn, again, to Plato.
 
Next is the affinity argument. Here, Socrates points out that there are two kinds of existence: material and immaterial. On the one hand, there is the
 
125 existence that our dog, a black forest cake, and a tandem bicycle have. These are
material things, they are extended in space and made form matter. They can be made
and they can be destroyed, and they visible to the senses. By contrast, there are also
things like the concept of goodness and the number two. These do not have a material existence. Try as we might, we have never seen goodness itself broken down
on the side of the road, and we have never jammed our toe on the number two in the
middle of the night. These things do exist though, as we can talk meaningfully about
them and what is true of them. Yet, they are not extended in space, are invisible to us,
and cannot be made or destroyed. Socrates then asks which kind of existence the soul has. Surely, he points out, it is immaterial. After all, it is not visible to us directly
through our senses and we have never had a dog grab our soul off the ground and
run away with it. If this is right, however, it would have profound implications as, as
we have already said, immaterial things cannot be created or destroyed. As such, death cannot be the destruction of the soul because such a thing is not possible at all.
 
Finally, Socrates arrives at the argument from the form of life. Here,
Socrates builds off of what he has already established. While what a form is can be
further unpacked in our discussion of Plato, we should still be able to understand it on simple terms. Take, for example, a houseplant. As Socrates has already shown, the
houseplant can be destroyed because its existence is material. By contrast, the
concept of houseplant cannot. Indeed, it can’t be changed in any way. If we try to
imagine the concept of a houseplant but it now refers to a particular massive blue whale off the coast of Massachusetts, we simply are no longer talking about
houseplants. We can change the plant itself by pruning its leaves or watering it so
that it can grow, but we seem unable to change our concepts. These unchanging
immaterial concepts are, for Socrates, called ‘forms’. Yet, what does this have to do
with us or our death? Socrates tells us that the soul is, necessarily, the thing that gives us life. Accordingly, its immaterial essence cannot be changed either. It is essentially
alive and that means that it must remain alive.
 
With that, Socrates believes himself to have proven that his death will not be
permanent. Others are not so convinced. Indeed, when Socrates asks if Crito is now convinced, he tells him that he is not but that he doesn’t want to press the issue, as
Socrates’ beliefs clearly give him comfort in this moment and Crito would not want
to rob him of that. Having reached an impasse, Socrates tells the others to conceal his
 
126 body from Crito after his death, because Crito thinks that that that body is him. In
turn, Socrates’ jailer arrives with a cup of hemlock, a drink made from a poisonous
plant. Socrates has a pleasant conversation with the jailer, asking him how to take the
mixture and what will happen, and the jailer clearly distraught at his own role in Socrates’ death. Socrates drinks the hemlock and, in his last moments, tells his
students that they owe a rooster to Asclepius. Asclepius, here, is the god of healing.
Socrates is asking his friends to make a sacrifice of thanks to Asclepius for healing
him for, in Socrates’ view, material life is but a brief affliction we must endure before
returning to our true existence in the immaterial realm. Having said that, Socrates passes into death.
 
Socrates’ death will ripple through the ages. Athens has, in the eyes of many
of Socrates’ students, killed the best of us. In turn, these students will now take up
the project of vindicating the master. No student does more with the pieces Socrates has provided us with than the very student who best preserves the historical record of
his life and death. This is, of course, Plato, who we can now turn to,

Plato 
 
Where we last left the story of Greek philosophy, Socrates had brought it
down from the cosmos and into the marketplace. The Presocratics were interested in
highly impractical matters, such as the ultimate nature of reality. What immediate difference did it make to someone trying to put food on their table whether
everything is made of water, undifferentiated being, or tiny invisible atoms? Of
course, this kind of speculation eventually led to a scientific practice in the
Mediterranean, but the fruits of this kind of Presocratic thought will be left ripening for at least several centuries. By contrast, Socrates’ philosophical life was one of
engaging with average people and on the topics that average people care about (e.g.,
justice, piety, truth, and life after death). However, Socrates had been roundly
punished for these efforts by the people of Athens. His most famous student and
biographer, Plato, would not make the same mistake. He had little patience for the masses, having been born to incredibly wealthy parents and having seen the ultimate
end of Socrates at the hands of a democratic public. Democracy was fickle, and there
was no assurance that it pointed towards wisdom. These considerations lead Plato to embark on a two-pronged project. On the side of metaphysics and epistemology, he
is concerned with understanding how we come to genuine knowledge. A good
explanation, for Plato, will reflect the fact that there is a fact of the matter about the
way things are, that knowledge of it is difficult to come by, and that people will resist
any effort to be brought to wisdom. On the side of value theory, Plato is concerned principally with how society could be constructed to avoid the circumstances that
befell Socrates. The question most on Plato’s mind is what form of government
would reward the wise, rather than punish them. This requires an account of justice
and the state, but it also first requires that we be able to differentiate the wise from the unwise. This, in turn, means that we need an account of knowledge itself.
 
129
Plato first came under the tutelage of Socrates when he was a young man,
and he remained a student and friend until Socrates’ death almost a decade later.
Despite the eventual fame of both of these figures, we know very little about Plato’s
life during this time. However, upon Socrates’ death, disillusioned by the intellectual life in Athens, we know that Plato spent a number of years traveling. His time as a
student of Socrates had led to one of his two central tendencies. As we have already
pointed out, Plato inherited an inability to go along with the predominant views of
society. Anaxagoras likely influenced Diotima of Mantinea, Diotima likely
influenced Socrates, and Socrates certainly influenced Plato. All of Plato’s predecessors along this lineage had been tried for impiety (assuming, as this story
does, that Diotima and Aspasia were the same person), and Plato carried with him
the same disregard for popular opinion. However, Plato’s second tendency came
fully into fruition during his travels, when he began spending time in Italy among the Pythagoreans. Plato’s own mother, Perictione, is sometimes believed by some to
be the same Perictione who is attributed with producing multiple works of
Pythagorean philosophy (chief among them is a work providing a philosophical
account of wisdom as the chief virtue and warning of the dangers of women
focusing on physical beauty).28 This second tendency is a profound love for
mathematics, the objects it describes, and mathematical reasoning. The first
tendency will characterize his ethical and political writing and the second will inform
his epistemology and metaphysics.
 
While in Italy, Plato was invited to provide counsel to the Sicilian tyrant
Dionysius. However, he quickly wore out his welcome and was sold into slavery by
the king. After friends raised money and bought his freedom, he returned to Athens
and founded a proper school. The school was called the Academy, being named after
a shady grove in which the Greek hero Academus is said to have died. Having now established himself as a philosopher and teacher in his own right and, having spent
time thinking about how to build a just society, Plato couldn’t pass up the
opportunity for another shot at real political influence. This time Dionysus’ brother
 
28 This Perictione is sometimes referred to as Perictione I. This is so as to avoid confusion with another ancient Pythagorean philosopher, referred to as Perictione II. Perictione II is known to have defended the view that there is only one true underlying principle of reality on both metaphysical and epistemic grounds. 
 
130
Dion recruited Plato to become the tutor of Dionysus’ son. Dionysus II would
eventually become the ruler of Syracuse (in Sicily) and with Plato’s influence, his
head could be easily filled with ideas about wisdom and justice. While he apparently
had some initial success in this endeavor, and philosophy reached new heights in Sicily, political turmoil saw Plato imprisoned and new rulers in charge. After his
eventual release, Plato returned to Athens for a second time, defeated in his political
ambitions once again. There, he returned to teaching at the Academy and continued
to do so until his death. He may not have realized his ideal form of government, but
he had produced a school in which his ideas could live on. While there are at least two different stories about the circumstances of Plato’s passing, he apparently made
it to old age in either case. In one story is said to have died sleeping while a young girl
played the flute. On another account, he died while attending a wedding feast.
Regardless of the circumstances, and regardless of the fact that he may have considered his political activities a failure, Plato’s death shows that he was at least
able to leave Athens a place where a philosopher could live long enough (and safely
enough) to die of natural causes. Further, his philosophical legacy is incredibly
difficult overstate. Indeed, the philosopher Alfred North Whitehead once wrote, and it is now often said, that the entirety of the greater Mediterranean philosophical
tradition (sometimes know as European or ‘western’ philosophy) merely consists in a
“series of footnotes to Plato.”29
 
Ethical Philosophy 
 
In what is, perhaps, his most famous work, the Republic, Plato picks up
where Socrates left off: the soul. Plato follows Socrates in affirming the immateriality
of the soul and, as such, the possibility of an afterlife. However, Plato’s most pressing
concern is not with the afterlife but with life itself. The topic at hand is how we ought to live our lives so that we can attain happiness. One might be tempted to
think that achieving happiness is merely a matter of attaining a lot of valuable things.
It is hard, after all, to be sad when you have everything you could want at your
 
29 Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality (Free Press, 1978), 39. 
 
131 fingertips. Likewise, there are plenty of ways we can live our life if our goal is simply
to accumulate stuff. For instance, we could become a famous musician, invent
something valuable, or simply inherit the profits of an emerald mine. Indeed, if we
want to attain worldly success like this, it might only slow us down to do it justly. Becoming rich (and therefore happy) is relatively easy if all it takes is for the strong to
steal from the weak. This leaves the characters of the Republic wondering if living a
life of justice will lead to happiness or whether we ought to just pursue our own
interests at all costs.
 
The first thing we can say about a life of total injustice, for Plato, is that it isn’t practically advisable. Even the evilest people are capable of coming together to
collaborate so they can realize their evil plans. Indeed, being totally unjust won’t
actually tend to help you to realize your ambitions. Even if happiness is just a matter
of collecting stuff and amassing power, we still need to cooperate with others in order to get the things we desire. However, we might still wonder whether we should
be any more just than this requires. While we can’t be totally unjust and also achieve
the happiness that justified that injustice, we can still choose to be either generally
just or unjust. Do the just live happier lives than the unjust? Glaucon, a sophist contemporary of Socrates and Plato, raises this problem by developing a thought
experiment called the ring of Gyges. Here, a shepherd is tending to his flock when he comes across a ring that grants him the power of invisibility. Given that he can
now do whatever he would like without being detected or caught, he uses the ring to sneak around the castle of his king, seduce the queen, and with her help, kill her
husband (and thus become king himself). Glaucon argues that all people, were they
given the chance to avoid the consequences of committing injustice, would do so.
We all would succumb to the power of the ring of Gyges because we know, deep in
our hearts, that injustice is more profitable than justice. It is only the constraints of society that keep us in line. While some may say that justice is the key to happiness,
their actions under circumstances like these reveal their true feelings.
 
In order to address Glaucon’s argument, Plato has Socrates (now reduced to a character through which Plato expresses himself) appeal to function. Scissors have
the function of cutting paper or fabric and shoes have the function of covering our
feet while we walk around. The functional nature of these things provides us with a
criterion for evaluating them. Good scissors fulfill their function by cutting and bad
 
132 shoes fail to cover our feet while we walk. For Plato, the soul has its own function
which can, in turn, provide us with a way to judge it good or bad. What is the
function of the soul? Plato argues that the function will be whatever it is uniquely
suited for. We can tell that scissors are designed to cut because they are in the best position to do the things we expect scissors to do. For humans, this unique role is the
exercise of rationality, and the soul’s unique job in this task is in governing the body.
This means that, just as an ear excels in its function when the parts that make it up
work harmoniously together towards hearing, good functioning of the soul requires
its parts to be in harmony.
 
We might think it sounds strange to talk about the soul having parts, but
this is (at least in part) because the ancient Greeks talk about souls the way that we
talk about the mind. Contemporary scientists talk about the mind as if there were
discrete modules within it, fit for distinct tasks. Fo instance, the limbic system is often said to play a significant role in governing the emotions, there is said to be a
language system involving the Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas, and there is visual-
perceptual system employing the occipital lobe. In the same way, Plato thinks that
the soul has parts which should cooperate if we are to flourish. Here, Plato provides
his tripartite theory of the soul. First, there is the most noble part of the soul, the rational soul. Plato conceives of it as residing or at least functioning in the head and
as consisting in the parts of us which push us to act in accordance with reason.
Second, and below the rational soul in nobility, is the spirited soul. Plato argues that this resides in the thorax with the heart, the seat of the emotions, and as consisting in
what we might call our will. Finally, the lowest part is the appetitive soul (or having to
do with the appetites), which is located in the abdominal cavity. This is the desiring
part of the soul. Together, this means that the excellent and efficient operation of the
soul requires harmony and order between these parts.
 
How is such an order achieved? First, the rational soul aims at wisdom. Its
function is, after all, to reason, and what is the aim of reason if it isn’t wisdom?
Meanwhile, the appetitive soul has the function to motivate us to fulfill our basic needs through our desires, but ultimately to obey reason. We can see this in our own
cravings. Our appetites often betray us. During the course of a delicious meal, it is
tempting to always want one more bite. Yet, afterwards, when we’re feeling sick from
so much chocolate cake, we often wish we hadn’t succumbed to the pressures of our
 
133 appetite. Even if we get by after one meal, we know that we wouldn’t be very happy
if we only ate chocolate cake all of the time, despite it always looking so good. There
is wisdom in setting aside our short-term desires and reasoning our way to better
choices. Reason, it would seem, is always looking out for us if we could only obey it. This, for Plato, would be evidence that we live more ordered lives when the
appetitive soul is governed by the wisdom of the rational soul and, in this case, that
seems to mean practicing a little temperance.
 
Between the rational and appetitive souls is the spirited soul; the forceful
and energetic side of our nature, which Plato will refer to as ‘spirit’, but which we might call the will. Our will, in contrast to our appetites, is not in and of itself
ignoble and low. Governed entirely by sensory pleasures, we might do nothing but
lay about and play video games. The will, at least, is the foundation for some
admirable things, like strength and resilience. When these traits aim at something worth aiming at, the will is responsible for a number of great accomplishments. It
aims at courage or fortitude because, if its function is to enable meaningful and good
activities, then it would best fulfill this function by embodying these virtues.
However, since the spirited soul is, in itself, unintelligent and therefore susceptible to becoming blind ambition, it must ultimately subordinate itself to reason. This
provides us with a model in which the spirited soul is a servant to the rational soul,
but one whose job is to tame and direct the base desires of the appetitive soul.
 
The struggle for each of us is, then, a struggle to use our willpower to reign in (quite literally for Plato) our appetites and emotions and to bring ourselves into
good functioning order. This struggle is illustrated in Plato’s famous allegory of the charioteer. Here, Plato asks us to imagine a driver on a chariot being pulled across
the sky by two winged horses. One of the horses is well-behaved, and the other is untrained. Accordingly, the driver will have a hard time managing to keep them
straight. The well-behaved horse is always pulling upwards towards the beautiful
heavens, but the poorly trained horse is always attempting to drag the chariot down
towards earth and its correspondingly earthly delights. The charioteer and the two horses represent the three parts of the soul. The poorly trained horse is the appetitive
soul, as it desires only to lay about and eat apples it finds on the ground. The well-
behaved horse is the spirited soul, as it has the strength and training to drag the
poorly trained horse along, kicking and screaming. Finally, the driver is the rational
 
134 soul, who directs the one obedient horse towards some destination worth going to.
Accordingly, a just soul is one in which the driver of the chariot has control of the
two horses and is guiding them towards the heavens.
 
This picture allows Plato to finally answer the augment raised by Glaucon.
Why should we strive for virtue? Virtue is, here, identified with the health of the soul. The unjust person thinks that they are living a life of freedom. After all, they are
free to use people however they want and free to satisfy all of their desires. However,
this is simply equivalent to the driver confusing the freedom of the poorly trained
horse with their own. If the driver fails to reign in their desires and aim at wisdom, they aren’t really in control at all. Instead, they are simply sitting around at the mercy
of one very lazy and very hungry part of themselves, unable to control themselves or
achieve anything more than sensory pleasures. Thus, even though we may see the
unjust person and think that they are happy, only virtue enables true happiness and freedom. As we have seen, each part of the soul has its function, which aims at some
virtue (temperance for the appetitive soul, wisdom for the rational soul, and
fortitude for the emotional soul). Justice arises in the proper ordering of the parts of
the soul in accordance with the virtue fitting for each. These four virtues
(temperance, wisdom, fortitude, and justice) make up Plato’s four cardinal 
virtues.
 
Social Philosophy 
 
If Glaucon’s challenge, with the ring of Gyges, is one of justifying justice
itself, then we are only halfway done. Plato has given an account of why it pays to be
just, but what does justice consist in? If we have learned anything from his discussion of virtue in the individual, we know that justice involves everything running
smoothly, and in well-ordered fashion, towards the rational dictates of wisdom.
Luckily for us, the just society works in just the same way. Society, like the soul, is
made up of competing elements, and a just society is a well-functioning one; where all of the parts work in harmony. Plato takes this analogy to run fairly deep.
According to him, there are three classes within society, which correspond to the
 
135 three parts of the soul. First, there are the rulers, whose characteristic virtue is
wisdom (and who correspond to the charioteer). Second, there are the warriors, who
should aim themselves at strength and fortitude (just like the well-trained horse).
Finally, there are the laborers, who should try to be temperate in their desires like the poorly trained horse. What it means to be just, for any particular person, is just to
fulfill the role that their class ought to fulfill.
 
The analogy runs deeper still, however. Just as the appetites are prone to
short-term thinking and can’t be trusted to know what is truly best, so too are the
laborers, who are liable to swing wildly back and forth in indulging their worst vices. If the virtue of temperance for the appetites is a matter of them properly deferring to
the wisdom of the rational soul, then temperance for the laborers is in them properly
deferring to the wisdom of the rulers. If we demand evidence that the masses can’t be
trusted to govern themselves on the basis of anything other than immediate and unthinking desire, Plato would have us look no further than the fact that the
democratic masses were responsible for Socrates’ guilty verdict and subsequent
death. Of course, the goodness of an arrangement in which they defer, instead, to
rulers depends on those rulers living up the virtue appropriate to their class: wisdom. Thus, when the rulers are wise, the laborers are deferential and temperate, and the
warriors have the strength to keep the laborers in line with the dictates of the rulers,
we have a well-ordered society.
 
To the modern reader, this is likely to sound highly authoritarian. This is by design. As we have already said, Plato believes that ordinary laborers can’t be trusted
to act in or even know their true rational interests. For this reason, the state must
have the ability and power to force them towards wisdom and the common good. As
far as Plato is concerned, Democracy had spoiled its chances when it forced the hemlock on Socrates. Of course, we might protest that Plato’s ideal form of
government doesn’t embody values like freedom and equality for regular everyday
folks. However, this is a feature and not a problem as far as Plato is concerned. That
people who didn’t dedicate their lives to seeking wisdom could rule over the best of us is a perversion of governance in his eyes. Regular people at least have the good
sense not to imagine that they know better than the engineers how to run a nuclear
power plant, but they fail this test when it comes to running a government. Yet, if we
 
136 aren’t ruled by popular opinion, then who should rule? If rulers aim at wisdom, then
Plato finds no better rulers than the philosophers themselves.
 
Plato argues for this social arrangement with a thought experiment called
the ship of state. He asks us to imagine the crew of a ship deciding which direction
to steer. Everyone, it seems, has an opinion, and there is no clear method to decide which way to go or who ought to determine their course from among them. Each
appeals to their own experience as a sailor and argues that it gives them the expertise
which should be expected from a captain. Left to their own devices, they fight
amongst themselves for control and call ‘good’ anyone who helps them in gaining power. Among them is a navigator, who spends their time looking up at the stars.
The other sailors ridicule them for this. If they should want a claim at steering the
ship, they should focus on practical matters that would provide them with
experience. However, we know that the question of who should steer the ship is not simply a matter of deciding from among a number of equally valid opinions.
Navigation requires focused attention on the stars and skill in this is uniquely
qualifying for the task at hand.
 
This story serves two purposes. First, it shows us that the common person, like the common sailor, is prone to quarreling and not qualified to be in charge.
Second, it shows us that the person most qualified to be in charge is the philosopher.
It is no surprise that Plato appeals to the navigator as his stand in for the philosopher.
Socrates, after all, was accused of having his head in the clouds and ridiculed for concerning himself with things in the heavens, just like Thales. Philosophy, like
studying the stars, appears to be an impractical matter to regular practical people.
Yet, reason reveals it to be superior when it comes to deciding where to aim our
efforts. The argument that Plato puts forward here is that if we think that leaving unqualified common people to decide amongst themselves how to run a ship is a bad
idea, then why not think the same is true for a society, which is much larger, more
important, and more complicated than a ship. Likewise, who is better qualified to
rule than the person who concerns themselves with the heavens. If the rulers are empowered to steer the ship of society, it is in virtue of their wisdom. Who better to
be a ruler then, than the philosophers, who are driven solely by a love of wisdom. In
this way, Plato’s ideal society will be ruled by the philosopher kings.
 
137
Plato's Republic represents an effort to realize, to the fullest degree, a
paternalistic government. Plato still imagines regular people to have opinions and
desires, he merely imagines them to subordinate those desires to the interests of the
society. Likewise, his ideal republic is not one characterized by equality. We have already seen that he endorses a class system in which people are divided into one of
either laborers, warriors, or rulers. However, these classes are not entirely fixed. For
instance, one’s position in society is not determined by who their parents are. This
applies to rulers as well. Plato’s philosopher kings are not selected by being born to
the current or future king the way we normally think of kings. Likewise, rule is not exclusively the domain of men (again, despite the name ‘philosopher kings’). Instead,
Plato argues that one’s position within this system ought to be determined in youth,
and according to the potential skill that a child demonstrates.
 
First, Plato contends that children should be examined at birth and unhealthy infants should be cast aside. The remaining babies are then given a
rigorous education by the state. This system of education is very strict, with a
curriculum passed down from on high and expected to be followed exactly. Even the
children’s toys are specifically selected to encourage their development. Moreover, maintaining control over the education of children will require removing them from
their parents’ care permanently. The state is their new family. Children will not
know their real parents and parents will not know which is their child. This serves
the added benefit of securing impartiality. Eventual rulers and warriors can’t act to benefit their family if they don’t know which people they are related to. This same
strict supervision will follow them throughout their lives, as their education will
simply be undone if the state doesn’t equally regulate their private lives. Promising
children will advance in instruction and stand a chance at becoming warriors or
(eventually) even rulers. Less promising children will be spat out of the education system to work as laborers.
 
What is life like for regular laborers in Plato’s republic? The state is aimed at
wisdom under the guidance of the philosopher kings, and it must be safeguarded from outside influence and from upstart laborers. Accordingly, there should be no
foreign trade or interaction with outside societies for members of this class. Likewise,
the arts are to be under strict surveillance and control. Emotionally exciting music is
to be limited and theater is to be banned. Socrates had already reported that artists
 
138 were not reliably wise and Meletus (in bringing the charges against Socrates) had
proved that the poets were not to be trusted. Artistic merit is less important than
virtue and, accordingly, poetry should be limited to state-sanctioned hymns about
the gods.
 
If one is able to make it to the warrior class, their lives will become even more regulated. Beyond removing them from their family to ensure impartiality,
they will also not be permitted to own property. Why? Well, we might worry that
agents of the state will engage in corruption in order to make themselves rich. We
protect ourselves against this by disallowing them from owning any property at all. This, in turn, requires enforcement, and enforcement requires transparency.
Included among the property that they will not be allowed to own are private
residences. Instead, they will live in a common barracks, where there are no locks on
the doors, ensuring that anyone can enter at any time and verify their virtue. They live like soldiers, without privacy or property, sharing all of their meals in common,
and receiving only enough pay to cover basic expenses. In addition, there would be
no marriage from love and spouses would be held in common like property. Just as
we worried about the corrupting influence of parents, spouses provide us with incentive to quarrel and to place our concern for some above others. Thus, all
pleasures and pains are common pleasures and pains. Without unique desires or
interests, people’s desires can be brought into alignment with the common good.
 
Finally, like with the education of children, nothing about the setup of the government can change. The last thing we need is an upstart innovator who meddles
with a perfect system because they have new ideas. This brings us to the last piece of
the puzzle. In order to maintain a consistent supply of wise rulers, the state should
compel the wisest men and women to have children together. This is certainly made easier without marriages from love or individual spouses. However, Plato recognizes
that forced child-rearing would be especially unpopular. In the service of preventing
people from producing children across the classes, Plato argues in favor of a noble 
lie. Here, citizens would be told that the different castes had different kinds of metal added to their blood (gold for rulers, silver for warriors, and brass or iron for the
laborers). This story would be given a religious significance, and people would be
warned that God would not tolerate the mixing of these metals in the blood. This
would encourage people to stay within their caste but allow that God would gift the
 
139 occasional golden-blooded child to bronze-blooded parents. Those parents, Plato
believed, would welcome the opportunity for their children to climb the social
ladder.
 
While we might find this entire story rather repelling, it also has its
advantages in Plato’s eyes. He has shown us a world in which people identify their interests with the group’s. There is equality between the genders, public education,
and total transparency in government. Likewise, there is no avenue for ideological
disagreement or marital strife. The wise are left to govern and the common people
are left to benefit from that. Like Shang Yang and the legalists of classical Chinese philosophy, Plato advocates for a meritocratic system. People are elevated to
positions of power on the basis of their skill; in this case, when it comes to
philosophizing. We may worry that such a system could become corrupted. By
concentrating power in the hands of the state, Plato has set the table in the event of an eventual tyrant. However, he does not concern himself with these matters. This is
his ideal state in the truest sense of the word; this is the form of government which
follows from his ideals. If we want to focus on the realities of our less-than-ideal
world, then Plato recognizes that there are some problems when it comes to its implementation. First, there was the previously discussed problem of people wanting
to have kids with a partner of their choosing. Second, however, is their general
reluctance to allow a philosopher to rule. Regular Athenians wouldn’t even let
Socrates live, much less rule. Finally, Plato recognizes that regular Athenians will not happily and readily let women be in charge of the government. For these reasons,
Plato concludes that, unfortunately, not even the noble lie will be enough to make
his vision a reality. However, Plato’s focus on ideals is a consistent theme in his work,
and it is one we find expressed in theories of knowledge and reality as well.
 
Metaphysics & Epistemology 
 
As mentioned above, Plato is concerned especially with the ideals and standards for how we judge things. He had developed a teleological account of
human existence, in which we are uniquely suited for rationality. The soul, in turn,
 
140 can be judged on whether it fulfills the ideal form of governance over the body.
Likewise, rulers should be judged according to the ideals of wisdom embodied in the
charioteer. Even the state has an idealized version, which Plato presents to us despite
knowing that our imperfect world will not permit it to be realized. Everywhere, it seems, Plato is sensitive to the looming gap between the ideal standard revealed to us
by reason and the paltry attempts at realizing this standard which are all around us.
Reason reveals a world of perfect governments, perfect rulers, and perfect humans
with perfect souls. These things serve as objective standards against which we can
judge our beliefs and the world itself. Remember that Socrates’ first enemies, the sophists, did not share his commitment to the search for the objective truth. One
such sophist, Protagoras, was famous for saying that ‘man is the measure of all
things.’ Plato interprets this to mean that what is true is merely a matter of subjective
opinion and, for him, this will simply not do. The project of vindicating Socrates involves showing that he possessed genuine knowledge, and that the sophists were
wrong. This, in turn, means providing a perfect objective basis for evaluating the
truth of claims.
 
In response to the sophists, Plato points out the self-defeating nature of Protagoras’ relativism. If truth is merely a matter of opinion, then the truth of that
very statement is merely a matter of opinion. Thus, in Protagoras asserting what he
thinks is true, he has undermined his own position and affirmed the truth of his
opponents as well. The sophists focused their attention on persuasion and rhetoric, which could shape opinion, but they were famous for their ability to shape it one
way and back again the next day. Genuine knowledge, Plato argues, is fixed. Once
you really know that two plus two equals four, you are not liable to change your
mind. This returns Plato to the divide which had characterized the Presocratics,
between reason and sense experience. Beliefs formed on the basis of sense experience, like those based on persuasion, can be overturned. What we conclude is an apple
may, upon closer examination, actually be a peach. These concerns had led the
Eleatics to affirm reason alone, even if it meant denying change, motion, creation,
and destruction. They concluded that what is revealed by reason is sticky in the mind, and Plato follows suit.
 
When Socrates interrogated Euthyphro, he insisted on a definition of piety.
While Euthyphro wanted to simply give him a list of pious things, Socrates
 
141 maintained that genuine knowledge would be about the nature of piety itself. That
is, wisdom consists in knowing what unifies these instances and makes them all cases
of piety. This focus, on the common and essential nature of things, will define
Plato’s quest for knowledge. What Socrates wanted in the case of piety, Plato wants in the case of all things, from virtues to mathematical objects to plants and animals.
To have genuine knowledge about a thing is to know the nature of it; to be able to
recognize all and only genuinely pious acts as instances of piety, and all and only
genuine poodles as poodles.
 
Yet, if our knowledge is of these universal categories (e.g., the concept of piety, the concept of poodle, and the concept of circle), what can we say about these
concepts themselves? If knowing the true nature of a concept allows us to identify
the real instances of it, we might still wonder whether that concept itself is real, and
what that would mean. One tempting answer is to say that there are really just a bunch of individual animals (the physical creatures) and that the concept ‘dog’ is one
we invented to talk about them as a group. The concept has no real existence. The
problem with this story, for Plato, is that our knowledge is of these concepts. What
do we have knowledge of if they do not exist? The quest to understand the nature of piety led us to focus on the universal concept, so universal concepts must be
primary. Like the Eleatics, what is good for reason, on Plato’s account, is good for
reality. Of course, as we mentioned in our discussion of Socrates, we aren’t going to
run into a five or the concept of a poodle in a stairwell, or drive past piety itself, broken down on the side of the road. This means that they must exist in a different
way than how things exist in our world. Our physical universe is one of particular
poodles and particular triangles. The world that universal concepts occupy must be
distinct; a place where they can exist as universals in a separate kind of reality. This is
why they maintain their universal claim to knowledge. What is true of these concepts is true everywhere and all the time because the world that they inhabit is permanent
and unchanging. This allows our knowledge of these concepts to be fixed and
enduring as well. Plato calls these universal concepts forms, and we can call the world
they inhabit the realm of forms.
 
Most of the previous philosophers in his tradition had been motivated to
find an underlying principle of the world precisely because they believed it to be one
unified thing (despite its appearances). Plato has shattered this. There are two realms
 
142 of existence and two ways of being. Socrates and the Pythagoreans had asserted
dualism in the case of the body and the mind; they are two distinct substances, and
their fates are not necessarily tied together. However, Plato is the first in this
tradition to provide a complete dualistic model of the world itself (something we have so far only seen in Indian philosophy). The physical world revealed to us
through the senses is constantly changing; its poodles come and go and, accordingly,
its facts may be overthrown. What is true today may not be true tomorrow, and
what is true of one tree may not be true of another. By contrast, the form of the tree
and the form of the poodle remain the same, fixed and universal in applicability. This allows for genuine knowledge and the superiority of the realm of the forms
renders it more real than our own world.
 
The technological innovation of this model is that, for example, the realm of
forms opens up a possibility of a perfect form of justice, which is and will always be perfect and true regardless of popular opinion. The same can be said for beauty. The
ordinary person on the street may be content to focus on our lower world and be
satisfied with everyday beliefs about the world as it presents itself. They are fine with
a mere list of virtuous actions and beautiful things, and they don’t bother their heads about virtue and beauty themselves. The philosopher, however, sees through the
imperfections of our world and into the realm of the forms. This is what
distinguished Socrates from his accusers and from the sophists, and this is what will
vindicate him. We now have an objective standard for truth, we need only a way to get at it.
 
We can call the model Plato proposes, in which the world is divided into a
sensible impermanent and imperfect realm of matter and a permanent and perfect
realm of forms which are grasped by reason, his theory of forms. While it might sound strange to say that there is a world beyond the everyday in which the essential
true idea of justice, beauty, triangle, and dog exist, it should not be so strange to us.
We are taught from an early age that math describes ‘perfect circles’, and we
recognize that they don’t exist in nature and are impossible to draw. Of course, we can draw better circles with sufficient practice or with a compass or computer.
Likewise, these circles might be perfect enough for our purposes as we can’t detect
their imperfections. Nevertheless, we know that with a good enough microscope, we
could detect minor imperfections in the smoothness of the line we drew and that
 
143 those imperfections would result in marginally different lengths if that line was
drawn out to be straight. These differences, between perfect enough circles, also
represent deviations from the ideal description of the circumference of the circle that
we get when we say it is ‘equal to two times pi multiplied by the radius’. Nevertheless, these imperfections don’t cause us to deny the existence of circles
altogether or to revise our mathematical description of a circle’s circumference. We
don’t say that we found out, through science, that circles aren’t actually the way that
math describes. Instead, we call the circles of our daily lives imperfect circles and
quietly lament that they lack the universally applicable and permanent perfection that the mathematical description gives us. For Plato, individual circles ‘participate in
the form of the circle’, and we can judge them based on how well they embody this
form. This common understanding of the perfection of the mathematical objects
that reason describes, and the imperfection of their material counterparts is a Platonic notion. Given the deep relationship between math and nature, which
physics reveals, why not think that natural objects have their immaterial perfect
counterparts?
 
This story allows Plato to resolve a problem we can call Meno’s paradox (which takes its name from the character by which and dialogue in which it was
introduced). Here, Meno (who was apparently a student of the sophist Gorgias) and Socrates are discussing how we come to knowledge when Meno presents him with
the dilemma. If we want to learn something, then we must already know about that thing in order to seek out knowledge about it. This would mean that learning is
unnecessary. However, if we don’t already have knowledge about it, then we could
never come to seek it out in the first place. This would mean that learning is
impossible. That gaining new knowledge depends on having prior knowledge
therefore seems to mean that, one way or another, we can’t acquire new knowledge.
 
However, Plato is now in a position to reply to Meno. We are able to learn
in our life because our knowledge is of the forms, and these exist in an immaterial
realm. This is the world that our correspondingly immaterial soul inhabited before our birth and will inhabit after our death on Socrates’ account. Prior to our birth, we
had perfect knowledge of all forms, because we were acquainted with them in the
immaterial realm. Thus, the process of learning is actually one of recollection. We are
born remembering only very little about the forms and, through experience and
 
144 reason, we recall a more perfect understanding. We can call this the doctrine of 
anamnesis, or the theory of recollection. Notice that this view draws heavily on Socrates’ views which he expressed at the end of his life. We had said that Socrates
had some reason for thinking that we are capable of remembering events from previous lives and we now know why. Indeed, all of human knowledge is a
remembering of knowledge from previous lives because if it were not then
knowledge itself would not be possible.
 
We should also, once again, stress the similarity between this view and
elements of Pythagoras’ doctrine of reincarnation. Both Plato and Pythagoras esteem geometry and math, and we know that Plato studied with Pythagoreans in his
travels. Indeed, as we have already said, his own mother might have been a significant
Pythagorean philosopher in her own right. Likewise, both thinkers contend that the
mind and body are distinct, that there is life before birth, and that there will be life after death. However, Plato’s doctrine goes further than Pythagoras’. It follows
Socrates’ suggestion that there was a first life, in the immaterial realm, but adding
that, in this life, we were acquainted with perfect knowledge of everything. After
this, we are incarnated as many times as it takes to earn passage back into the realm of the forms. For most of us, we aren’t yet ready to return, but the philosopher recalls
enough of that perfect knowledge that they need not continue the process of
reincarnation.
 
Beyond the theory of recollection, however, Plato can still say more about how we come to knowledge. The world is divided into our physical world of
particulars and the immaterial realm of the forms. Accordingly, we can gain insight
into the physical world through our senses and knowledge of the forms through
reason. This division, and the account of knowledge which emerges from it, can be
called the divided line. Here, Plato asks us to imagine a segment of line which is divided in half and in half again. We can mark off these segments and label each with
its own letter:
 
| | | | | _____ _____ _____ _____
A                           B                            C                           D                           E 
 
145
From A to C, we have the perceptible world of our senses as presented to us
by our bodily organs. From C to E, we have the realm of the forms, evident to us
through the rationality of the soul. On Plato’s account, as we move from A to E, we
get closer to the ultimate truth of reality. The segment from A to B represents representations of the imagination. What we imagine is represented to us in
sensation. When we imagine a duck, it looks like a duck even if we know there is no
actual duck present for us to see. The imagined duck is a likeness of an actual duck.
The segment from B to C represents belief as a result of our perceptions. In this case,
we see an actual duck and believe it to be there in front of us. This duck is more real than the duck of our imagination. These two segments, from A to C, are forms of
opinion (imagination and belief). Their truth is private and particular.
 
With the segment from C to D, we have crossed over into the workings of
the mind. Plato has in mind here mathematical objects, which are not perceptible to the senses. We may perceive some piece of paper that has the shape of a triangle, but
we don’t see the triangle itself walking around (as a mathematical object free from
material constraints). However, we can access triangularity itself through our
thoughts about the triangle we see. Our knowledge here is stronger, because it involves the application of universal principles of triangularity and the exercise of
reason. For Plato, however, our increases in certainty as we move along the line
ultimately reflect a difference in reality. Thus with the segment from D to E, we have
genuine understanding. The objects of this understanding are the forms themselves. What is true of triangles as such (that is, the form of triangle) is true of all triangles,
whereas what is true of a particular perceptible duck is only true of that one duck.
This knowledge, like mathematical knowledge, is a product of rationality and not the
senses. This is the knowledge that philosophy can give us because it allows us to
grasp the forms. The thought that we get from C to D, combined with the understanding we get from D to E, form the body of knowledge (which is contrasted
with the mere opinions issuing from the area between A and C).
 
This account can be laid out thusly:
 
146
Plato’s divided line 
Segment  Mental State  Object Degree of  
Truth & Reality 
 
A – B  Imagination (Opinion)  Likenesses   Lowest 
 
B – C  Belief (Opinion)  Physical Objects  Low 
 
C – D  Thought (Knowledge)  Mathematical Objects  High 
 
D – E  Understanding (Knowledge)  Forms  Highest 
 
In this way, the divide between the higher mental world and the lower
physical world cuts through us as well. The body leads us to be persuaded to form beliefs which may change. These beliefs can be either true or false. Meanwhile, the
mind leads us to true knowledge, and this knowledge is permanent and unchanging.
This model should not come as a surprise to us given what Plato has already said
about the appetitive soul, which pulls the rational soul away from the realm of the forms the way that the poorly trained horse attempts to pull the chariot downward
towards earthly pleasures. In the end, our lives on earth are only a momentary
stopover before journeying home to the immaterial realm. During this stay, we are
barred behind the physical constraints of our senses and can only catch glimpses of the deeper reality we left behind (and will return to). However, we can catch these
glimpses. Particular trees are not perfect the way the form of the tree is, but they do
participate in it. Nature, due to its being tethered to the realm of the forms, arrives to
us segmented in natural ways. The job of philosophers, then, is to ‘carve nature at its joints’; to uncover the underlying forms (the more fundamental reality) according to
which nature is arranged.
 
This raises the question of how we come to knowledge on Plato’s view. In
this case, he is famous for defending the JTB theory of knowledge.30 Imagine that
someone told you that they knew that the earth is round but answered ‘no’ when you asked whether they believed it. This would certainly strike us as strange if not
 
30 Edmund L. Gettier, “Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?,” Analysis 23, no. 6 (1963): 121-123. 
 
147 outright contradictory. To this extent, we might think that knowing something
necessarily means that you also believe it. However, this is clearly not sufficient to
secure knowledge. As Plato has already pointed out, plenty of people believe things
without possessing any real knowledge. In order for a belief to count as knowledge, Plato argues that it must also be true. After all, it would be weird to claim that you
can know something that is false. This is what makes knowledge secure and lasting
on Plato’s account. Knowledge is of the forms and the forms are permanent,
therefore our knowledge of them is also lasting. Yet, while knowledge must be
believed and true, this is still not sufficient for real knowledge. Consider the following example. You ask a friend whether there was ice cream in the freezer, and
they answer ‘yes’. You ask them if they believe this to be true and they answer ‘yes’.
Further, as it turns out, there is ice cream in the freezer, so this belief is true.
However, when you ask them why they believed this, they answer that, each morning, they randomly decide what to believe is in the freezer. Did your friend
actually know that there was ice cream in the freezer? In either case, their ability to
know what is in the freezer is likely very unreliable. Then seem to have only gotten
lucky in this case, the way that Socrates thought that artists merely get lucky in saying something wise through their art. However, because Plato wants knowledge to be
secure and reliable, he holds that knowledge must also be justified in the right way;
by grasping the forms. When someone has good reason for thinking something true,
they will have lasting and genuine knowledge. Thus, for Plato, knowledge amounts to justified true belief (JTB).
 
The process of coming to knowledge through contact with the realm of the
forms is illustrated in Plato’s famous allegory of the cave. In this case, we are
supposed to imagine a group of people who have spent their entire lives living inside
of a cave. Here, they have been chained at the back of the cave so that they can only see the back wall and never face the exit (and the exterior world beyond). Between
them and the exit (and behind their field of vision) there is a large fire and short wall.
From behind this wall, and using this fire, their captors perform shadow puppet
shows which are visible to the prisoners. Indeed, these shadow puppet shows are all the prisoners have ever known. Here, they see the shadow of a bird, the shadow of a
tree, and so on. Plato argues that these people would come to think that these
appearances are the real thing; what a bird is is the shadow they see on the cave wall.
 
148
However, if one of the prisoners were to escape and make it out into the sunlight of
the real world, they would see that these shadows are just likenesses of actual birds
and trees.
 
Yet, before they could do so, the light of the sun would be blinding to them
and the real things they encounter in the surface world would be hard to make out. Indeed, this overwhelming surface world, with its blurry images, would frighten
them, and they are likely to prefer the comfort of the shadow world they are familiar
with. With a good amount of training, however, the freed prisoner could become
accustomed to life on the surface world. At first, they can focus on reflections on the surfaces of ponds or on shadows (as they had known before). After this, they could
look around at actual birds and trees, illuminated by sun and made easy for them to
see in detail. Finally, our hero could train themselves to the point that they could
look at the sun itself; the thing responsible for supporting life on the surface world and responsible for rendering it intelligible to them. To this person, the shadows of
the cave will now seem dull and worthless. Imagine further, however, that they
returned to the cave to spread the news of the beauty and reality of the outside
world, and to free their fellow prisoners. There, the freed prisoner will not see as well as those that remained behind, as their eyes have adjusted to the light. Likewise, they
will have no interest in the games being played by the shadows on the wall. In turn,
the prisoners will make jokes about the one who broke free. The freed prisoner
claims to have knowledge, but it has no bearing on the shadow world. It is totally impractical knowledge. Worse still, if the escapee tried to free any of their fellow
prisoners and enlighten them, they would put their rescuer to death before they
would be dragged, kicking and screaming, to the surface world.
 
Of course, in this analogy, philosophy is the method by which we can attain our freedom and knowledge of the real world. Those who concern themselves with
particulars and appearances are like the stubborn cave-dwellers, and the philosopher
who has seen the realm of the forms has escaped from the material world and
encountered pure truth and goodness only to be ridiculed for it. We can recognize, however, that we should all want to be the escapee and not one of those who refuse
to leave the falsity of the earthly world behind. If the particulars of our world are the
shadows, the real animals are the forms, regular folks are the cave-dwellers, and
philosophers are the escapee, then we still might wonder two things. First, what is the
 
149 sun, which is the cause of the forms, and which renders them perceptible to reason?
Plato tells us that it is the form of the good itself. If there is a form corresponding to
all of the trees and a form corresponding to all of the cats, then so too must there be a
form corresponding to all good things, such as the forms themselves. A second question will take a little longer to answer; what could possibly motivate the cave-
dwellers to seek out wisdom and goodness?
 
Here, we should return to Diotima of Mantinea. In Plato’s Symposium, she
presents the ladder of love as an ideal account of our romantic development. On
her view, people start off in adolescence loving some particular body. We don’t find out that we are romantic creatures by feeling attraction generally. Rather, we merely
find ourselves attracted to some particular person and, through this, come to realize
that we experience attraction generally. In this way, if someone is maturing properly,
they will eventually come to the realization that they love all beautiful bodies. Notice that this follows the model we saw in the divided line, where we move through
familiarity with the particular to more universal knowledge. This second stage allows
us to recognize the features which make people physically beautiful. From here,
maturity will (hopefully) eventually convince us that we love all souls, rather than just bodies. Our attraction is no longer merely to the physical but to the mental
(once again reflecting the divided line’s jump from the physical to the mental). After
this realization, we might want to know what makes the beautiful souls we love
possible in the first place and be thankful for whatever produces beautiful souls. The answer to this inquiry, for Diotima, is laws and institutions. A just society enables
the realization of beautiful souls, and we will come to love laws and institutions for
this reason. However, this only raises a further question: what makes for good laws
and institutions, the kind capable of producing such people? Here, Diotima tells us
that knowledge enables these laws and institutions, which makes sense given that people benefit (on Plato’s view) from a government guided by wisdom. Accordingly,
we will come to love knowledge as we mature even further. Finally, at this stage, we
will naturally and ideally inquire as to what enables us to come to knowledge at all.
The final stage of development on Diotima’s ladder is the love of the form of beauty itself.

Notice that this maturity will take us from simple cave-dwellers staring at particulars to genuine lovers of wisdom. Love is what can motivate us to venture out

of the cave. This is the fundamental reason why philosophy is philosophy (the love

of wisdom) and not sophology (the study of wisdom). The form of the good is the
form of the beautiful, as beauty consists in aesthetic goodness. In the same way, justice is just social goodness, virtue is ethical goodness, and wisdom is epistemic
goodness. With Plato’s theory of the forms, we have a complete system of
philosophy, in which his answers on every major topic build off of and support one
another. However, if Plato is the ambitious and systematic defender of the universal,
we will also get another, equally systemic, theory in which the particular will get its own champion. This can be found in the work of Plato’s student, Aristotle.

there is a chow chow in the car. However, unbeknownst to you,
you actually saw a woman with bushy white hair. However, there
was, incidentally, a chow chow laying down in the backseat out of
view. In this case, you seem to have a justified true belief that ‘there
is a chow chow in the car’, but did you know it? Why or why not? Is
this sort of case a problem for Plato’s JTB theory of knowledge?
Why or why not?

Aristotle 
 
Aristotle was born in Stagira, a Greek colony located in the north of
modern-day Greece. His family was well-connected with the Macedonian royal
court, with Aristotle's father being the physician to King Amyntas. However, both of Aristotle’s parents died when he was still very young, and he was sent at seventeen
to be educated in Athens. There, he found Plato and began studying at the
Academy. He continued to study there, eventually becoming a teacher himself.
However, after twenty years, Aristotle left Athens for reasons which are a matter of some dispute. On one account, he was frustrated by control of the Academy passing
from Plato to Plato’s nephew Speusippus (who rejected Plato’s theory of forms),
and further frustrated by the direction that decision led the school in. On another
account, he was forced to leave Athens due to anti-Macedonian sentiment. In either case, Aristotle left Athens to travel to Asia Minor with another student of Plato’s,
Xenocrates (known for, among other things, arguing for the seemingly Pythagoras-inspired view that the soul is a self-moving number). Eventually, Aristotle took on
his own student, Theophrastus (who would later be considered the father of
botany), and the two traveled to the island of Lesbos off the Ionian coast.31 There,
they conducted biological research, collecting and dissecting specimens from around
the island.
 
31 In terms of Theophrastus’ philosophical contributions, he is known for further elaborating Aristotle’s general framework, for defending the ‘principle of explanations’ (which argues that a single cause is never sufficient to fully explain a phenomenon), and for arguing that the character and nature of a musical pitch is a matter of how it sounds to us rather than its mathematical relationship to other pitches. This last view was adopted by a number of subsequent Aristotelians, including Archestratus and Aristoxenus, who debated the point with later Pythagoreans and Epicureans. More can be read about Archestratus, Aristoxenus, and this debate in the “Hellenistic Philosophy” chapter.  
 
155
In 343 B.C.E., Aristotle returned to Macedonia at the request of King
Philip, where he became the teacher of Philip’s son Alexander. Aristotle remained his
tutor for a time and would be repaid in financial support which could fund his
studies. Aristotle is said to have encouraged Alexander (who would come to be called ‘Alexander the Great’) to go eastward and conquer, but Aristotle himself traveled
westward, returning to Athens. There, Aristotle found Xenocrates in charge of the
Academy and so set about to found his own school at the Lyceum. The Lyceum was
a temple, open to the public, and had long been a regular place for philosophers to
meet and debate. Given that Aristotle was not a citizen of Athens, he was not permitted to own land, so began teaching students informally while walking along
the shady pathways of the Lyceum. His school would eventually take on the name of
the Lyceum and his followers would become known as the ‘peripatetic school’
(which means ‘given to walking about’). The name peripatetic would follow Aristotle, and the word would come to be used to describe anything having to do
with him or his teachings.
 
At the Lyceum, Aristotle spent his mornings teaching mature students on
the more profound questions of philosophy and his evenings teaching fundamentals to a general audience, This divided audience also characterizes his writings, with
some writings being for a popular audience (we can call these ‘exoteric’) and some
being for his students (we can call these ‘esoteric’). While Aristotle’s exoteric writings
were known to be quite stylish, only his esoteric writings survive to this day, and it is clear that Aristotle felt comfortable assuming a good amount of philosophical
background knowledge in them. Aristotle stayed in Athens for thirteen years, until
the death of Alexander left him a lone Macedonian in a hostile Athens. Aristotle, like
Socrates before him, found himself accused of impiety towards the gods and fled to
the island of Euboea. Famously, in defense of his decision to flee, he is supposed to have said that he would not allow Athens to ‘sin twice against philosophy’ (referring
to the execution of Socrates). He died while in exile on the island.
 
156
Metaphysics & Epistemology 
 
Aristotle is a comprehensive and systematic thinker. His writings cover a
wide range of topics, from ethics to language, logic to physics, and biology to art.
However, one field stands out as especially important for him. Aristotle thought of
metaphysics as first philosophy. That is, it is the most fundamental and important
inquiry. Metaphysics is first philosophy because it represents our best attempt to understand the world at its most fundamental and abstract; what it means to exist.
While we might find questions of physics or biology more pressing, metaphysics is
most important because it informs and grounds all other inquiries. With this in
mind, what does Aristotle’s metaphysics tell us? Here, he takes up Plato’s distinction between the universal form and the particulars of the physical world but expands
upon it and modifies it until it becomes a completely new system.
 
On Plato’s account, there is the world of universal forms (e.g., ‘dog’) and the
world of physical particulars (e.g., Fido). Importantly, these are distinct, and Plato identifies the universals with reality. Individual dogs are mere shadows on the cave
wall. The form of the dog is the reality which we must endeavor to grasp. Aristotle
accepts this way of thinking about reality in some ways but ultimately concludes that
the individual is the real. What, exactly, this means will require some unpacking though. For Aristotle, the problem of what is real is the problem of what things there
are. We have already seen that our language can provide us with some insight into
our concepts and, therefore, the world which these concepts might correspond to.
For instance, the problem of the one and the many can be motivated by trying to
understand what the singular ‘the’ refers to when we predicate of the universe that it is expanding. Our thinking, and therefore our language, tells us that the universe is a
singular and unified thing, and we must reconcile this fact with the plurality of
objects presented to us in our everyday experience. Aristotle is sensitive to this
connection between language and reality. Where Plato looks at a sentence like ‘Fido is a dog’ and sees the form of dog as the most real thing, and the particular Fido as an
illusion, Aristotle reverses this. What is real is the particular, the subject of our
predication. What there is is what can be talked about. Aristotle calls the subjects of
our predication substances. Fido is the substance because it is Fido that we are actually talking about. We predicate of him that he has the property of being a dog.
 
157
By contrast, this means that the universal ‘dog’ is what is predicated. In the sentence
above, we are not talking about dogs as such, we are talking about Fido in particular.
For this reason, Aristotle centers substances as the most real thing. This allows him
to carve our concepts up into substances (the real subjects of our thoughts and language) and the predicates we attribute to them. Universals (such as green) are
predicated of things (‘the ball is green’) and particulars are not. We can call this the
‘argument from predication’, which can be summarized as follows:
 
1.   Substances are the subjects of predication.
2.   The subjects of predication are particulars.
3.   Therefore, substances are particulars.
 
However, Aristotle goes further in his account of substances. He tells us
that, in addition to whether we might say it of something, we can ask whether our idea is present in something. What Aristotle means by this, exactly, is hard to say.
Nevertheless, a common view is that Aristotle thinks that the properties which are
present in something are essential to it and those that aren’t are said to be accidental.
An essential property is one that a particular kind of object must have in order to
be that kind of thing. For instance, a chameleon can have the property of being red or of being green in any given moment while remaining the same chameleon. These
colors are, then, accidental properties, because they are not essential to the thing’s nature. On the other hand, if a chameleon ceased being a lizard and began being a
fish, it would simply no longer be the same thing. Chameleons are, by definition,
lizards. Being a lizard, for a chameleon, is an essential property.
 
This raises an interesting point which complicates what we have already said
about dogs. Namely, there are some kinds of notions which are a subject of
prediction in some cases and a predicate in others. For instance, we can predicate of Fido that he is a dog (where the category ‘dog’ is the predicate), and we can predicate
of dogs that they are mammals (where the category ‘dog’ is the subject). This makes
the category ‘dog’ an essential universal (just as ‘lizard’ was in the chameleon
example). By contrast, colors, like the category ‘red’, might be accidental universals,
because they can be lost without losing the underlying substance. Correspondingly, an essential particular is the particular subject of predication, such as Fido. Finally,
an accidental particular would be something which the substance could survive
 
158 without (such as the chameleon’s color), but thought of in the most particular sense
(e.g., this particular chameleon's particular shade of green). This gives us Aristotle’s
fourfold division of substances. This division is illustrated in the table below:
 
Universal (Said of)  Particular (Not said of) 
 
Essential (Present in)  Dog  Fido 
 
Accidental (Not present in)  Green  The green of this fern 
 
Since Plato’s forms are universal and substances are particular, Plato’s forms
cannot serve as the underlying substances of reality. Accordingly, we might think
that, since Aristotle denies the prime reality of forms, that means that matter is the
primary substance. Where Plato puts the immaterial world first, Aristotle (being of a scientific mind) will put the material world first. However, this isn’t quite right. Just
as the Presocratics could see that the universe is unified and discrete by our saying
“the universe”, substances are discrete because they are particulars. Fido is an
individual dog; Fido’s matter is a mess of stuff. It’s not particular at all. Here,
Aristotle gives an argument that we can call the ‘argument from constitution’:
 
1.   Substances are particulars.
2.   Matter is not a particular, but that which particulars are made out of.
3.   Therefore, matter is not substance.
 
Where does this leave us? If the substances are not matter or immaterial
form, then perhaps they are some combination of the two. This solution is also
dismissed by Aristotle in his ‘argument from composition’:
 
1.   The substance of a thing defines it.
 
2.   A composite of a thing’s matter and form includes what it is made
up of (e.g., matter).
 
3.   If substance is the composite of matter and form, then a thing’s
definition includes what it is made up of.
 
4.   If a thing’s definition includes what it is made up of, then a circle’s
definition includes that it is composed of two semicircles.
 
159
5.   However, semicircles are defined in reference to circles, so we must
already have a definition of a circle before defining a semicircle.
 
6.   Therefore, definitions are impossible if a thing’s substance is the
composite of its matter and form.
 
7.   Therefore, substance can’t be the composite of matter and form.
 
It would seem that we have run out of options, since the substance isn’t the
form of a thing, its matter, or the combination of the two. However, Aristotle avoids
this problem by providing an alternative account of forms which is not subject to the argument from predication. Where Plato thought of the form as immaterial and
divided off into a separate realm of reality, Aristotle is skeptical of the division
between the world of forms and the physical world. For Aristotle, the forms are in
the physical things themselves, not in a different realm. Recall that the essential properties are in the things. Objects aren’t in conversation with a form existing in
another realm, they contain their own essences within them. We call this the
doctrine of substantial form (sometimes called ‘hylomorphism’). On this view,
the substance of a thing is a form contained within the particular thing and which that thing strives to embody. Accordingly, while Plato saw particulars as lesser
versions which participate, in part, in a perfect universal form, Aristotle has no
reason to see the universal as more real (or perfect) than the particular. Of course. we
might still wonder what exactly it means for the form to be in the physical particular.
To get a better handle on this, it will help to turn to Aristotle's answer to the problem of causation.
 
Here, Aristotle tells us that there are four senses in which one thing can be
the cause of another. Take the example of a pair of scissors. For Aristotle, to ask
about the cause of the scissors is to ask why they exist. On one view, the cause of the scissors is the person who made them: the manufacturer. They are the cause of the
scissors because they acted so as to bring them into existence. We can call this kind of
cause an efficient cause. On another view, the metal of which the scissors are made
could be said to be their cause. It might seem weird to us in modern times to think of the metal as having caused the scissors, but perhaps we can motivate Aristotle’s view
by thinking counterfactually. Counterfactual thinking involves thinking about
things as they are not. Just as the scissors would not exist had there not been a
 
160 manufacturer, they would also not have come to be if there were no metal to make
them out of. Since their existence is dependent on the prior existence of the material,
we can say that that material is a cause. We can call this kind of cause a material 
cause. Third, there is what Aristotle calls the formal cause. The formal cause is the design for the object. For an object to be scissors, it must have the shape of scissors,
with two handles attached to two blades and connected on a pivot screw. You can
make scissors out of metal or out of plastic so long as they have the proper design.
Again, counterfactually, if the manufacturer had put the metal in some other shape,
something would exist, but the scissors exist because they share in the design characteristic of scissors. Finally, scissors have a certain purpose. Scissors exist in
order to cut things. This can be said to be a cause because what something is depends
on its purpose. Had the manufacturer crafted the metal into that shape in order to be
displayed in an art gallery as a small metal sculpture, or to serve as a paper weight, then the resulting object would be art or a paperweight. Scissors, by contrast, are
made to work towards some end. Namely, cutting things. This object exists as a pair
of scissors because it is designed to cut things. Aristotle refers to this as the final 
cause, because it is the end which the scissors were made to fulfill. Aristotle thinks that these kinds of causes serve as different kinds of answers to the question ‘why?’
and truly coming to know the nature of a thing means coming to know its four
causes.
This theory of causation resolves the question we left open about the
doctrine of substantial form. Take, for example, a house. The material cause of the
house is the wood and bricks that make it up, the efficient cause is the builders who construct it, the formal cause is the blueprint or design of the house, and the final
cause is to be lived in. If the form is the substance, then we should think that the
blueprint is what we are referring to when we talk about the house. Yet, we can
distinguish between the blueprint and the house. Likewise, if the matter is the substance, then the wood and bricks are the house. However, we can also distinguish
between the house and the wood and bricks that make it up. To say that the house is
the blueprint and the wood is not quite right either, as you would not be satisfied if
your friend told you that they wanted to take you on a home tour of their new house
and simply showed you a blueprint and a pile of building supplies.
 
161
Instead of any of these answers, Aristotle says that the house is the blueprint
realized by the bricks. A house is not a mere combining of a blueprint and some
bricks, but a realization, the making real, of the blueprint in and through the
building materials. This is what he means by ‘substantial form’, and he thinks we can tell a similar story for natural objects as well. For instance, the substance of an oak
tree is the oaky plan for life represented by oak tree DNA which has been embodied
in some oaky plant matter. Aristotle argues that things have their blueprint for their
mature and fully realized form within them, and they strive to realize that vision. We
can call this guiding principle entelechy.
Aristotle’s largest departure from Plato is, then, that he unites form and
matter. For him, matter is always organized as some kind of thing; as occupying some form. On the other hand, we also never directly encounter pure forms as such. When
we see a triangle, it is always some particular triangle and never the concept of
triangle as a universal form. This means that matter and form are inseparably linked.
The form is the constant which the matter has the potential to, and sometimes does, realize. This is all well and good, but we should remember that predicates are
sometimes themselves substances. For instance, while ‘cat’ is the predicate in the
sentence ‘Kevin is a cat’, it is the subject in the sentence ‘cats are mammals’. Aristotle
is sensitive to this. Take the example of a statue. The material cause of the statue is the marble it is made of, and the formal cause is the design which the artist is
attempting to realize in the marble. However, there’s a reason why the artist is using
marble and not marshmallow. The artist chooses to use marble because it has the
properties the artist requires in a material. That is, it has the right form itself. The same could be said of what makes up the marble.  Calcite is the necessary material
required to realize the form of marble. Beyond this, the form of calcite can only be
realized when the matter that makes it up has the form of carbon, oxygen, and
calcium, and these can only be realized if the matter that makes them up has the form with the proper number of electrons, protons, and neutrons. Each level is
characterized by its own matter and form. The thing serves as matter to what lies
above it and form to what lies below it.
 
Yet, this picture only raises the question of whether there is something all
the way at the end; something that is pure form and doesn’t serve as matter to actualize some greater plan. The electrons and neutrons are only instruments for
 
162 realizing calcite and the marble is instrumentalized in the service of realizing a statue.
The matter at each level makes it possible to produce something greater. If there was
a being of pure form, then it would be the greatest possible being, valuable only for
its own sake and fully actualized. Aristotle thinks there must be something like this, and he identifies it with God. However, his God may be slightly different from the
popular idea of God now. Aristotle’s God is not a loving agent who is invested in the
events of our world, but a formal ideal. It represents the final cause of the universe;
the thing towards which all things directly or indirectly strive. Because it is an ideal, it
stirs us to act in its direction. For instance, we know that the painting in our heads will be beautiful, and we know that helping others would be good. Goodness and
beauty motivate us to realize these things, not because these abstract concepts act on
our body like one object bumping into one another, but because by thinking of
something good or beautiful we recognize that thing is worthy of being brought about. In the same way, God is the cause of things because of its inherently attractive
quality. Yet, this ideal is filtered down to us according to the particular kind of thing
we are. Because we are humans, we have, within us, an inherent sense of the beauty
and goodness of realizing our potentials as humans. The same is true for marble and the same is true for poodles. Each thing’s entelechy is a motivating ideal distinct to
the kind of thing that it is and tied up with that thing’s essential nature. Since this
entelechy gives each thing the purpose for which it strives, Aristotle’s view is, then,
an attempt to provide a teleological explanation for the essences of things.
 
By introducing the potential, already and always within a given thing, for
something to be different than it is, Aristotle arrives at an answer to the problem of
change which plagued his presocratic predecessors. Their worry was that change
requires a single consistent thing which changes over time. If it changes, then it must
be different between the time before changing and the time after. However, if it is different, then we might wonder how it remains the same thing. Change requires
that things be simultaneously different and the same. Aristotle now has an answer to
this problem. The essential nature of the thing remains the same. All that changes is
that what was once only a potential that that thing had has now become actual. Take, for example, a baby. Any baby could grow up to play the piano, were they
given the proper training and practice. In this sense, the baby can potentially play the
piano, even if it, of yet, knows nothing about the piano. We can call this first 
 
163 potentiality. Eventually, that baby might grow up and receive this training. Indeed, they may become quite successful as a pianist in a symphony orchestra in Cleveland.
Imagine that we run into our now mature pianist on a plane while traveling. They
tell us that they can play the piano and we demand that they prove it. There is a real sense in which they have actualized their potential to play the piano far more than
the baby. Indeed, there is a sense in which they can actually play the piano. Yet, we
have said that they ‘can actually’ do it, not that they are actually doing it. They are,
after all, on a plane, and there is no piano in sight. There is also a real sense in which,
in this situation on the plane, they can only potentially play the piano. We can call
this state second potentiality (or first actuality). Finally, when that pianist has arrived back in Cleveland, sits in front of the piano, and begins to play, there is no
sense in which they are potentially playing the piano at all anymore, their ability to
do so is fully actualized. We can call this second actuality. We can see that what it is to be a human includes the capacity to play the piano and nothing has essentially
changed about this person or their nature. Instead, they have only activated the
potential that was already there. This allows Aristotle’s metaphysics (with its
accounts of form, causation, and change) to avoid the problem of change altogether.
 
Beyond this, Aristotle’s account of change also allows him to say something
more about God. Objects in nature are clearly in motion. The milky way spirals
around, spinning gas and dust into stars. The moon spins ever around the sun and,
with it, the tides churn. Aristotle sees the natural world and thinks that there must be some beginning to it. The planets and stars must have been some way before they
were in motion. This, in turn, means that something must have set the natural world
into motion. Just as things couldn’t have always been spinning, they couldn’t start
spinning for no reason. These two ideas lead Aristotle to conclude that there must be
an uncaused cause of the universe. It must be a cause, otherwise nothing would move at all, and it must be uncaused, otherwise we could simply ask what caused it
to move. This cause would be pure actuality. It is fully realized and requires nothing
to set into motion in order to realize its potential, and we have already seen that a
pure form is fully actualized because it required no matter to realize it. Aristotle
identifies this unmoved mover with God, which we have already said is fully
 
164
actualized.32 Thus, we can say that God is both the first and final cause of the
universe, and pure actuality.
 
Stepping back, the picture Aristotle has so far been painting tells us that
sentences are composed of terms which refer to ideas which, in turn, fall into
particular kinds of categories (substances and predicates). These substances and predicates can be combined to form sentences. Of course, sentences which predicate
are not the only kinds of thoughts or sentences which we form. We can say that the
cat is on the mat, which is a predication, but we can also ask whether the cat is on the
mat. Likewise, we can make requests (‘would you place the cat on the mat’), give commands (‘place the cat on the mat’), or do any number of other things with
words. Philosophers call these various ways of using words ‘speech acts’. Yet, the
predicative sentences are the ones that allow themselves to be either true or false.
Accordingly, Aristotle puts propositional sentences like this front and center in his system of formal logic. Impressively, the account that he provides remained
unchanged for many hundreds of years and survives in use in some modified form to
this day.
 
Yet, while modern logicians regard this system computationally, as a system for converting basic inputs into new inferences, Aristotle thought it could tell us
much more. Because the type of thing that a being is is a matter of its form, its
categorization is both its cause and the ideal towards which it strives. For instance, in
the example above, Fido is the particular, and we predicate of him that he is a member of the category ‘dog’. What it means for Fido to be a good boy is a matter of
what it means for him to be a good dog. Likewise, dogs being good dogs is just a
particular case of some animals being good animals. Science can then tell us the
formal and final cause of beings by making the taxonomy of creatures clear. Fido is a member of the category ‘dog’, ‘dog’ is a member of the category ‘mammal’, and
‘mammal’ is a member of the category ‘animal’. Accordingly, by knowing that Fido
is a dog, we know that he is an animal. Aristotle calls an explanation which appeals to
 
32 In addition to the similarity between Aristotle’s argument and Udayana’s cosmological argument, Aristotle’s account of the unmoved mover will also be taken up by later Aristotelians like Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas will develop his own cosmological argument in order to justify belief in the Christian God. More can be read about Aquinas and his cosmological argument in the “Medieval & Renaissance Philosophy” chapter. 
 
165 this kind of categorization a syllogism. Syllogisms, for Aristotle, are arguments composed of two categorical premises and a categorical conclusion which follows,
and once we have a full accounting of all of the categories of beings, we will have a
complete picture of the nature of living things. In this way, Aristotle’s syllogistic logic is also the method of scientific explanation as well.
 
However, Aristotle has already told us that if we want to know the true
nature of the thing, we will know its cause. After all, it is one thing to say that all
dogs are animals (as it could be a lucky guess), and it is another to be able to say why
this is right. Aristotle’s syllogisms appeal to causation in their argument form. Take the following argument:
 
1.    All dogs are mammals.
2.   All mammals are animals.
3.   Therefore, all dogs are animals.
 
While this argument is specifically about dogs, we can extract its form and
apply it to a variety of cases. The more general form of the argument is given below:
 
1.   All a are b.
2.   All b are c.
3.   Therefore, all a are c.
 
We can call the concept in the a position the ‘subject term’, the concept in
the b position the ‘middle term’, and the concept in the c position the ‘predicate
term’. Syllogisms are, for Aristotle, just the arguments which fit this form. This represents a genuine path to knowledge because the middle term is the cause of
conclusion being true, given that it is what connects the subject term to the predicate
term. We can represent the relationship between these concepts visually using
something like a Venn diagram:
 
166
c
 

 
b

 
a

 
We can see that anything that falls within the category a, also falls within the category b, and that anything that falls within the category b also falls within the

category c. Importantly, it is still possible for there to be members of the category b

which are not members of the category a. The same is true in our example above. All

dogs are mammals, but not all mammals are dogs. Cats, for example, are members of the category b but not members of a. This means that cats would fall somewhere in
the space of the b circle which is not also occupied by the a circle. While Aristotle
took these categories to reflect the natural divisions between objects, modern
logicians still use diagrams such as this to represent different classes, or sets, of objects
(even if only hypothetical ones).
 
With this syllogistic reasoning, Aristotle is able to derive a system of logic.
At the center of his system is the square of opposition, a system for assessing the
relative truth and falsity of categorical claims. Characteristically, Aristotle begins by
making two distinctions. First, there are universal claims (e.g., all dogs are mammals) and particular claims (e.g., some dogs are poodles). Likewise, our claims can either
affirm something (e.g., all snakes are reptiles) or negate something (e.g., no birds are
reptiles). These two distinctions cut across one another, allowing four possible kinds
of claims: particular affirmatives, universal affirmatives, particular negations, and universal negations. This allows us to arrange them into quadrants as follows:
 
167






Affirmative  Negation 
 
Universal   All x are y (A)  No x are y (B) 
Particular  Some x are y (C)  Some x are not x (D) 
Aristotle argues that these general forms that claims take are related in a way
that allows us to infer things about the truth of one claim based on the truth of
another. For instance, if it is true that ‘all x are y’ (A), then it is false that ‘some x are
not y’ (D). Likewise, if it is true that ‘some x are not y’ (B), then it is false that ‘all x are y’ (A). The same goes for the relationship between B and C. That makes the
diagonal claims contradictory. Meanwhile, if it is true that ‘all x are y’, then it can’t
also be true that’ no x are y’ and vice versa. That makes A and B contrary.
Meanwhile, C and D are said to be ‘subcontrary’. This is because, while A and B can’t both be true, C and D can’t both be false. X’s are either y’s or they aren’t. It
might be that all of them are or that none of them are, but they must be one of the
two (y’s or not). We can call the principle that propositional statements must be
either true or false the law of excluded middle.
 
Finally, Aristotle argues that some claims are in a relationship of
‘subalternation’. This just means that one of the claims (the ‘superaltern’) implies the
truth of the other (the ‘subaltern’) but not the other way around. For instance, if it is
true that all x are y, then it is true that some x are y, but if it is true that some x are y, it is not necessarily true that all x are y. Thus, the square of opposition can be
illustrated like this:
 
168






The square of opposition 
 
Universal

 
All x are y. No x are y.

 
Affirmation Negation

 
Some x are y. Some x aren’t y.

 
Particular

 
While it would be modified by future scholars, Aristotle’s syllogistic logic

would remain, in large part, intact as the dominant form of propositional logic for the next two millennia.

 
Finally, we have reached Aristotle’s theory of the soul. Remember that Plato

thought that our souls were immaterial, which explains why they are able to survive

after death, but also how we are able to attain knowledge of the immaterial forms (through recollection). By contrast, when Aristotle discusses the soul, he has in mind

something closer to ‘life’. Living things have souls and different souls afford different

kinds of life. This places Aristotle’s theory of the soul firmly within his account of

biology. Aristotle thought of living organisms as being arranged in a kind of hierarchy, in which some creatures have only simple souls (capable of simple ways of

life) and in which other creatures have more complex souls (capable of more

complex ways of life). Importantly, each time we move up the hierarchy, those more
complex lifeforms have souls capable of everything that souls below them are capable of, but also more.
 
169
First in Aristotle's hierarchy of the soul is the nutritive soul. This merely
describes the capacity for and necessity of nutrition. Some very simple creatures
(such as plants) have only nutritive souls. Their capacity for nutrition is what
separates them from inanimate objects like rocks. Beyond this, some creatures have nutritive souls and sensitive souls. Sensitive souls allow the creature the capacity to
perceive things through their senses (whatever those senses may be). Aristotle
thought that all animals meet this criterion. Further still, some animals have
locomotive souls. In this case, in addition to nutrition and perception, animals with
locomotive souls are also capable of moving themselves. Given his time studying marine animals, Aristotle was familiar with the fact that there are animals (perhaps
like sea sponges) which lack the capacity for self-movement despite being able to eat
and perceive the world. We can contrast these with locomotive animals (like dogs,
birds, snakes), which are capable of self-movement. Finally, only humans have the
final kind of soul which Aristotle describes: the rational soul. This gives us the unique capacity for reason. Because this is what sets us apart, for Aristotle, from the
other members of the category ‘animals’, it can provide us with a definition of what
it is to be a human; humans are rational animals.

This model of the soul is interesting for at least two reasons. First, the
different aspects of the combine to make a single mind, but they are distinct and
subordinate to one another in the same way that they were for Plato. Just as the
appetitive soul works in the service of the rational soul, the locomotive, perceptible, and nutritive souls exist for the sake of realizing the potential of our rational soul.
Because we are, fundamentally, rational animals, our nature provides us with a
blueprint for life based in reason. Given what Aristotle has already told us about the
form of a thing providing us with an ideal for that thing’s development, and that
humans are characteristically rational, he now has the resources to articulate his moral philosophy. We can derive how we ought to behave in life from facts about
our essential nature. Humans should strive towards realizing a uniquely human ideal,
but what does that ideal consist in?
 
Value Theory 
 
Aristotle is, first and foremost, a virtue ethicist. This means that his theory, like Kongzi’s, puts character traits, rather than consequences or rules (or anything
else), at the center of morality. A good life, for Aristotle, is one in which we embody
virtue and avoid vice. He thought that such a life would bring the person living it
happiness. However, Aristotle conceived of happiness in much broader terms than we might today. For instance, you might think that a life of only lying about, eating
chocolate, and watching television would make you happy. We would likely not,
however, say that the person living this life is flourishing. This kind of happiness is
mere pleasure. The word ‘flourishing’ brings to mind a person who is accomplishing challenging goals, growing emotionally and intellectually, developing relationships
with those around them, giving back to their community, and working on
something worth working on. This is what Aristotle has in mind when he says
happiness. Both of these terms (‘happiness’ and ‘flourishing’) are frequent
translations for what Aristotle calls the highest good: eudaimonia.
 
Eudaimonia represents, for Aristotle, the aim of human life; the end
towards which we should strive and the basis for evaluating whether we or anyone
 
171 else lived a good life. He concludes this because flourishing in this way satisfies three
criteria which we would expect from the highest good towards which we should all
aim our lives. Such a good would need to 1) be desired for its own sake, 2) Be desired
only for its own sake, and 3) all other goods are desired for its sake. Sure, we might desire chocolate cake, but we desire it because it tastes good, and that taste makes us
happy momentarily. Accordingly, it does not satisfy our first criterion. Likewise,
while we might desire being well-read, people sometimes desire being well-read
because others will think highly of them, or because it will help them strategize better
ways of getting other things they want. In this way, being well-read fails the second criterion. Finally, while we might desire being in a loving relationship for its own
sake, and only for its own sake, it is not the reason why we desire everything else.
Your desire for chocolate cake is not ultimately rooted in your desire for a loving
relationship; it's desired because it is tasty. However, what all of these desires have in common, Aristotle thinks, is that we really want them because we think satisfying
them will make us happy. Further, when we are right, and our desires don’t
disappoint us or lead us astray, we are living not just a happy life, but a flourishing
one. Of course, some will find it easier to be happy than others. Those with plenty of friends, family, and money will have an easier time of flourishing than those without
these things. Yet, Aristotle thinks that true happiness is something which we can
accomplish for ourselves, and not merely a matter of luck. What, then, is the path to
happiness?
 
Aristotle’s answer is, as we have already seen, that virtue is the key to
happiness. Just as we might need a certain level of the right kinds of skills in order to
craft a good piece of furniture or to build a good house, we need a certain level of the
right kind of skills in order to craft a good life. The virtues (e.g., temperance,
fortitude, justice, and courage) are the skills that are required of us and obtaining them is a matter of practical knowledge. Sure, we can read books about carpentry,
but very few of us could then immediately go build a functional and beautiful
cabinet afterwards. We can read books about bike riding, but actually riding a bike is
a matter of being sensitive to certain things that we can only be sensitive to by getting on the bike. We know that things like courage, justice, and temperance are the skills
we need, but using those skills in any given situation is an ability we refine through
moral decision making and action.
 
172
For Aristotle, virtue lies in the mean between two vices. We can call this the
doctrine of the mean. To illustrate this, imagine a perfect coward, who is afraid of absolutely everything. Someone who is constantly afraid will not live a flourishing
life. They will fail to take any risks and miss out on the rewards that come with rising to the occasion and pursuing what one truly believes in. However, at the other
extreme is someone who is never scared. This person can’t exactly flourish either.
They are liable to get themselves and those they care about injured or hurt in some
way. They would rush into battle even when they stand no chance of winning and
even when retreating would ultimately be to their tactical advantage. They wouldn’t study for exams or look before crossing the street. Aristotle calls this person
foolhardy. Indeed, Aristotle notices that the foolhardy person actually has no chance
to be brave. Being truly courageous isn’t in never being afraid, but in overcoming
those fears when we need to. Sometimes we ought to be afraid, sometimes we ought not to be. Likewise, sometimes we ought to overcome those fears and, other times,
they should prevent us from acting until the conditions change. Mastering a skill is a
matter of being able to tell when we’re going too far towards one extreme and being
able to find the right balance between these two extremes under new circumstances which we have never encountered before. Courage, then, as a virtue is the mean
between cowardice and foolhardiness. Aristotle thinks that this picture is true of all
virtues. The virtuous person is so skilled at finding this mean that it becomes second
nature. At first it will take a lot of thought on our part to find the mean and become sensitive to the right things, but good habits will lead us to a point where we need
not put much effort in at all. It’s just like riding a bike. It might seem like a lot at
first; moving the legs to work the pedals, making small adjustments to steer straight,
and maintaining our balance all at the same time. However, most of us know that bike riders ultimately stop thinking about all of these tasks altogether; they simply get
on and ride. The same is true, on Aristotle’s account, for those skilled in being
virtuous.
 
As we have seen, Aristotle’s teleological theory is quite powerful. If we know
a thing’s true nature, then we will know its final cause (or purpose). If we know a purpose, then we now have a criterion for evaluating it as either good or bad. That
humans are, fundamentally, rational animals, tells us how humans should live their
life. A person who has lived a good life will have flourished as a rational animal and
 
173 the person who didn’t do this will have lived a bad life. Aristotle applies this
functional approach in other domains in order to learn more about what it means to
be good or bad. One of these domains is aesthetics, which is concerned with how we
ought to evaluate art.
 
Artworks, like people, can be either good or bad, and other philosophers have already attempted to root the value of art in other domains. For instance, Plato
was skeptical of the value of art because of its potential to lead people away from the
truth, and Xunzi explained the value of art by referencing the social good it could do
in bringing people together. However, these are attempts to explain the value of art itself, not what it means to be a good or bad work of art. Aristotle’s account of the
value of art centers on uniquely aesthetic, or artistic, value. Works of art are valuable
as works of art, not because of what they do for society. Aesthetics is, for Aristotle,
its own domain, and the reasons why a piece of art is good will not be the same kind of reasons why something is good in life or in politics though these things are related.
Many people today think that a work of art is bad if it is immoral, or at least that a
work’s being immoral makes it a worse work of art. We can call this position
‘moralism’. Moralists today come in many different varieties. Plato was a moralist in this way, and he and Xunzi were both aesthetic instrumentalists insofar as they did,
in fact, think that art is valuable because of its function in bringing about something
else valuable. However, by dividing up reasons for value into separate camps (e.g.,
political reasons, moral reasons, and aesthetic reasons), Aristotle is defending (in some form) a separation between the moral and political on one side, and the
aesthetic on the other. This position, in which moral and aesthetic reasons are
distinct, is called ‘autonomism’. The debate between autonomists and moralists
persists to this day.
 
Yet, if we should judge art according to its own criteria, then we might
reasonably wonder what that criterion is. Indeed, even if we think works of art
should be judged based on their morality or politics, we might still think that there
are unique artistic reasons which matter too (and which must be weighed against moral considerations in determining the value of the work). Ancient Greek art, like
much of art today, was representational. That is, it is supposed to depict things
which the audience might recognize. This is especially true for a book or film
depicting real people. We expect works like this to accurately capture some aspect of
 
174 the real person. Likewise, we might be tempted to think that a portrait is good to the
extent that it really looks like the actual person it’s of. Meanwhile, if the story is of a
fictional person, we still expect the character to act in ways that we would recognize
as human. For instance, we anticipate that characters in movies will behave rationally and, when they don’t, it can take us out of the experience of the movie in a negative
way. Plato and Aristotle call representational works like these works of mimêsis.
 
Thinking about art in terms of mimêsis is what led Plato to dismiss its value.
Works of art represent reality, but those representations are not based on the artist
grasping the forms, but on being inspired. Since inspiration is not a reliable source of knowledge, art has the potential to lead us away from the truth. For that reason,
Plato is inclined to think it should be heavily censored. Aristotle, by contrast, takes a
more positive view towards art. He doesn’t defend the value of art itself, but does
think that children should be educated in the arts and music, which presumes they are of some value. Instead, Aristotle is focused on what makes individual works
valuable as works of art. Here, he is especially interested in poetry. While the word
‘poem’ might conjure someone professing their undying love to someone else in our
modern minds, mimêtic poetry was an enormously popular and broad category at the time. Epic poems were often quite long, contained a number of characters, and
told a story using those characters. It should be no surprise to us that Aristotle thinks
that poems are ‘functional kinds’. That is, poetry is a category defined by the
function that works of that kind are supposed to fulfill. Since, on Aristotle’s account, all natural objects have final causes (including humans), they have
purposes, or ends, which they ought to work towards. The same is true, he argues,
for works of poetry. For Aristotle, narrative poems (rather than philosophical works
of poetry) are supposed to elicit pleasure in the audience. Engaging with poems,
whether by reading them or seeing a performance of one, should bring us pleasure through mimêsis. This makes Aristotle’s account a version of aesthetic hedonism.
 
However, Aristotle can go further than this. Aristotle divides these narrative
poems into two categories: tragedies and comedies. Each of these categories is, itself, a functional kind. Poems are characterized by their having meter mimêsis, artistic
poems (in contrast to philosophical ones) aim at pleasure, and artistic poems of
various kinds aim at pleasure by way of some particular emotion or set of emotions.
Tragedy, for Aristotle, works to elicit pleasure through pity. Aristotle notices two
 
175 things about our tendency to pity others. First, the person must be in a bad situation.
We don't pity those who are living flourishing lives. Second, we only pity someone
when we think that they don’t deserve their fate. For instance, when a villain ends up
being brought down, we rejoice rather than pity them. These two things tell us that a work which aims at getting us to pity the character should depict some admirable
person being brought low for reasons that seem unfair to us. Accordingly, if
tragedies are supposed to do this, then we can judge works of tragedy based on
whether the character in question is truly are and are depicted as admirable, and on
whether the circumstances which bring about their tragic situation are or aren’t deserved. By contrast, comedy works to bring us pleasure through mockery. Where
tragedy depicts great people (who have been put in terrible circumstances), comedy
depicts lesser people who in some way deserve their fate. When a kind old woman
slips on a banana peel, we aren’t inclined to laugh. By contrast, consider a cruel person who, in an act of public bullying, happens to slip on a banana peel and
thereby embarrasses themselves instead of their victim. Those gathered around might
erupt in laughter as the lesser person gets their comeuppance. This is, for Aristotle,
the essence of comedy. Yet, if the character getting their just deserts is too bad of a person, or suffer too greatly, then the work will fail to work as a comedy. Aristotle
thinks that we need to like the characters of a comedy even if we judge them for
particular failings they have. In the same way, by suffering too much, Aristotle
thinks that the audience will be drawn into pitying them instead of laughing.
 
Notice, though, that while Aristotle has not defended the value of art as
such, there is an implied defense in what he has already said. Why are works like these
valuable? Beyond the pleasure we feel in engaging with them, they open up the
possibility of moral development. If flourishing is a matter of being a skilled
practitioner of moral virtue, then works of mimêsis can serve as practice cases; helping us become sensitive to the relevant facts in acting morally. Indeed, truly
understanding a work of comedy or tragedy requires of us that we already at least
have some sense of what it would mean to be a greater or lesser person, and under
what circumstances we might deserve punishment or reward. Further still, in taking pleasure in this, we get an added emotional weight to our moral knowledge. It is one
thing to know what actions are right and wrong, but knowledge like this isn’t
motivational. Merely knowing that it is wrong to steal is one thing; seeing the
 
176 consequences unfold is another. Here, the victim is someone who is otherwise
admirable, and we know that they don’t deserve the circumstances they find
themselves in after being victimized. Works of art, whether tragedy or comedy, add
emotional weight to moral judgements which can, in turn, help to motivate us to pursue justice. While the pleasure we feel in the moment is reason enough to find
them valuable, for Aristotle, engaging rationally with works of art can also help us to
lead flourishing lives which aim at the good.

Hellenistic 
 
Philosophy 
 
The time after Aristotle, in ancient Greece, is a time of enormous change.
Greece had long consisted of a number of independent city-states (e.g., Athens,
Sparta, etc.), which Alexander the Great had brought under Macedonian control. Alexander’s death had created a power vacuum and the resulting violence caused
Aristotle to flee for fear of facing the same fate as Socrates. Fighting between various
factions around Greece continued for some time. This period of conflict, between
Macedonian and Roman rule, has come to be called the Hellenistic period. Alexander’s campaigns had taken Greek soldiers all the way to India and some of
those soldiers brought back the insights they had learned from Indian philosophers
while on campaign. Likewise, without Macedonian protection, Greek colonies in
Asia Minor and Africa were left to defend themselves from rule by the Persians or Egyptians to varying degrees of success. Contact with these other regions brought in
new influences and the philosophy that emerged during this era would remain
popular through the time of the Roman Empire.
 
The conflict and uncertainty characteristic of the time period manifests
itself philosophically in an important way as well. Plato saw the good life as tied up with the community. The individual ought to be, in some sense, subservient to the
interests of the state. By contrast, a revolving door of rulers and occupiers meant a
diminished sense of community and less loyalty to the government. Individuals were
left on their own, as it were, to find happiness for themselves. Accordingly, philosophy takes on very practical ambitions; in providing us with a plan for the
good life as individuals. However, whereas Aristotle had felt emboldened enough to
 
179 view happiness as a life of flourishing, the Hellenistic philosophers set their sights
slightly lower. Conflict rendered true flourishing difficult, and many were inclined
to merely work towards a stable life which was free from trouble. The Hellenistic
Greeks refer to this state as ataraxia. The word is also sometimes translated as ‘tranquility’, but it goes slightly further than merely not having any troubles. On
another translation, it refers to being imperturbable. That is, not merely free from
trouble, but unable to be troubled. This kind of secure stability, regardless of what
life throws at us, emerges as the ideal form of the good life in the Hellenistic period.
What, exactly, this consists in, and how we can achieve it, becomes the central problem of philosophy in Greek and, eventually, the Roman world. Here, answers
abound. Various schools emerge offering a path to the good life and many depart
significantly from the earlier work of Socrates, Aristotle, and Plato.
 
The Cyrenaics 
 
First among the Hellenistic schools is the Cyrenaic school. The Cyrenaics
take their name from the Greek colony of Cyrene (in modern day Libya). The
school’s founder, Aristippus of Cyrene, had traveled from Cyrene to Greece in order to attend the Olympic games. While there, he heard stories of a man named
Socrates who taught in Athens. After seeking him out, Aristippus was so impressed
that he continued to study under Socrates until about the time of Socrates’
execution. Unlike the rest of Socrates’ students, however, Aristippus did not eschew
the finer things in life, and he didn’t shy away from charging his students a fee in order to learn. This quest for an easy life led him to travel widely and thereby avoid
the Athenian politics that had ensnared Socrates. In terms of his travels, we know
that Aristippus spent some time serving in the court of Syracuse under either
Dionysus (who had sold Plato into slavery) or his son (who had been a student of Plato’s). Likewise, he is also believed to have been imprisoned for some time by the
King of Persia and to have spent some time shipwrecked on the Greek island of
Rhodes. The Roman architect Vitruvius tells us the story of this shipwreck, saying
that Aristippus wandered from the shore until finding a gymnasium and began talking philosophy. He talked for so long and impressed enough people that they
 
180 began to give him gifts. These gifts allowed him to clothe and care for the rest of the
survivors of the shipwreck. When they eventually secured safe passage home,
Aristippus preferred to stay behind and continue talking philosophy.
 
It is controversial whether Aristippus of Cyrene ever wrote down his ideas
but if he did, none survive to us to this day. Instead, Aristippus’s ideas outlived him because he taught them to his daughter, who he named his intellectual successor.
Little is known about the life or work of that daughter, Arete of Cyrene, beyond
the fact that she took over the leadership of the Cyrenaic school upon her father’s
death, and that she had a number of accomplished students. The most famous of
these students is, perhaps, Aristippus the Younger, who was her son. The Cyrenaic doctrine which we know today comes from Aristippus the Younger, though we only
know of it through its descriptions by other sources. The same sources tell us that
the doctrine originated with Aristippus of Cyrene and was refined into a complete system of philosophy by Arete of Cyrene and Aristippus the Younger. Accordingly,
it is probably safe to attribute authorship of the school’s ideas to all three rather than
any one.
 
Cyrenaicism, as a philosophy, reflects the life of the school’s founder, Aristippus of Cyrene. He was a student of Socrates who later sought out the finer
things in life. In this way, Cyrenaicism weds the skepticism of Socrates with the idea
of pleasure as the highest good. Their skepticism, however, is not global. To
understand their view, it might be helpful to make a distinction which will remain
with us throughout our journey; between the objects of perceptions and their
causes.33 When we look at a large live oak tree, we can distinguish between the
experience of green and brown color which appears in the mind, and the cause of
that experience (the tree). Indeed, we might think that the colored shapes I see
constitute an image of a live oak tree on account of having been caused by such an object. However, this story would require of us that we have some familiarity with
the tree beyond our experience of it. Yet, the Cyrenaics would deny that this is
possible. We can have knowledge of the objects of perception, but not of their
 
33 We might think of this as equivalent to the distinction between experience/appearance and reality or between noumena and phenomena. More can be read about this latter distinction in the “Immanuel Kant” chapter. 
 
181 causes. Indeed, the Cyrenaics take the first claim further in arguing that we have
perfect knowledge of our perceptions. After all, we might be wrong that the tree was
actually green (as it appeared on first inspection), but how could we be wrong that it
appeared green to us?  The same is not true of the causes of perceptions. Knowledge of these objects is not only imperfect, but impossible. In defense of this claim, the
Cyrenaics offer at least two arguments.
 
The first point made by the Cyrenaics is that perception is relative to the
perceiver. To most of us, a chocolate cake will taste sweet and delicious, but to a
person with a head cold, it will taste flavorless and uninspiring. Two circles might look as different as night and day to one person and the same to a colorblind person.
It is not clear, however, how we could settle a dispute between two people who
disagreed on what color a given object is. Both parties will appeal to their experience,
and the Cyrenaics claim that they both have infallible knowledge of the way that object appears to them, but there is no higher court than the court of individual
perception in which the matter can be settled. Beyond this, even in cases where
everyone agrees about the color of an object, we can’t know that our experiences of
the color refer to the same thing. Perceptual experience is fundamentally private, taking place only in the theater of one’s own mind. This raises the question of how
we could know that one person’s blue (for instance) was the same as another’s. We
can call this the problem of inverted qualia.34 This problem persists as a looming
philosophical question even today, but the Cyrenaics take the issue to be devastating for our potential knowledge of the actual object we are perceiving.
 
This skepticism manifests itself in the Cyrenaic outlook on ethics as well.
Just as knowledge was focused on the limited scope of one’s private internal
experience, so too is their prescription for how we ought to live. For the Cyrenaics,
ordinary sensual pleasure is the highest good towards which we can aim. Importantly, this isn’t to say that we ought to maximize everyone’s pleasure, but just
our own. They distinguish between bodily pleasures (such as the delight we get from
drinking a refreshing drink on a hot summer day) and intellectual pleasures (such as
the satisfaction we feel upon learning a new language). The school stands as
 
34 The term ‘qualia’ here just refers to sensory properties as we experience them subjectively (e.g., the way red looks to us).  
 
182 something of an outlier among philosophers and philosophical systems because they
take bodily pleasures to be superior to intellectual ones. They argue this on the basis
that bodily pleasures are more salient than their intellectual counterparts. In defense
of this, look no further than our practices of criminal justice. If the pains and pleasures of the mind were more vivid than those of the body, then we would punish
offenders mentally rather than physically. In this way, our social habits reveal what
we already know to be true. Further, their skeptical outlook pushes them to focus on
short-term gratification. We might think that a doctrine of bodily pleasure will lead
us to pursue ever grander and more exquisite sensory experiences; putting off eating a spoonful of icing so that we can eat the finished cake. However, the rewards of
tomorrow are as uncertain as the objects of perception. For evidence, look no further
than the political climate in Greece at the time. For this reason, Cyrenaicism defends
the value of the immediate and actual over the promising and potential. The
Cyrenaics ethical position can be called egoistic hedonism. It is hedonist because it regards pleasure as the only good and pain (as its opposite) as the only bad.
Meanwhile, it is egoistic because it argues that individuals should act only for their
own good rather than for that of others.
 
The Cyrenaic school defends a coherent philosophy, but it should be no
surprise that it fell quickly out of favor among philosophers. Indeed, those that take
the doctrine seriously have good reason not to continue on pursuing the life of the
mind. After all, there is little we can truly know the nature of, and we are better off pursuing sensory pleasures than deep insights into the fundamental nature of reality.
Nevertheless, later adherents did develop these ideas further. Hegesias, for instance, might have been influenced by Indian philosophy due to the presence of Buddhist
missionaries in Cyrene at the time he was alive. This is believed because he ultimately
concluded that pleasure was impossible in life, and that one should merely attempt to avoid suffering. This drove him to advocating for a life of total disinterest. The
fullest expression of this view is probably in the fact that (according to the Roman
orator Cicero), Hegesias wrote a book advocating for death by starvation as the ideal
solution to life’s problems. The book was apparently popular and convincing
enough that Hegesias was barred from teaching in Alexandria. Anniceris, a student of his, sought to expand the individualistic view of morality advocated for by early
Cyrenaics, by arguing that love of family, friends, and country can bring individuals
 
183 great pleasure. In this way, Cyrenaicism need not focus only on the private pleasures
of sensory experience. Finally, Anniceris’ pupil Theodorus argued that pleasure and
pain are not the most important experiences.35 Instead, they are only valuable or
invaluable insofar as they bring us joy or grief. However, despite these modifications, Cyrenaicism eventually fell away in the face of the stiff competition offered by rival
schools. Perhaps the closest relative to the Cyrenaic school is the Epicureans.
 
The Epicureans 
 
Epicurus was born on the Ionian island of Samos around the time of
Plato’s death. He studied atomist and Platonic philosophy before opening his own schools in Lampsacus and Mytilene (the capital of Lesbos). However, these were
mere precursors to the school Epicurus would eventually found in Athens. The
Garden, as it came to be known, was a commune as much as it was a place of
learning, and it served as the home of the Epicurean school. There, Epicurus sought
to put his ideas into practice. The Garden is notable as the first philosophical school in ancient Greece to have accepted women as students by default rather than in
exceptional cases. While no writing survives to us to this day which is attributable to
these women, we do know their names (e.g., Batis of Lampsacus and Leontion).
Despite the lack of primary sources for their work, it is safe to assume that they (like
the other students at the Garden) were instrumental in further developing the doctrine which originates with Epicurus. This is, perhaps, especially evident in the
fact that, according to the Roman orator Cicero, Epicurus was known to praise
Leontion’s skill as a philosophy above her male counterparts.
 
Beyond its progressive orientation towards the issue of gender, the Garden
was also the only Greek school open to slaves. Students would eat their simple
(probably vegetarian) meals in common and live amongst one another. Ancient
 
35 This Theodorus is sometimes referred to as ‘Theodorus the Atheist’ in order to avoid confusion with a much earlier mathematician named Theodorus, who was also from Cyrene. This mathematician, sometimes referred to as ‘Theodorus of Cyrene’, appears in several of Plato’s dialogues, and Plato is sometimes counted among his students.  
 
184 historians tell us that the public perception of the Epicureans was a negative one.
Salacious rumors were spread about the school, its founder, and its teachings. These
rumors tend to equate Epicurus’ teachings with those of the Cyrenaics; individual
sensory pleasure, rather than moral duty, is the highest good. One of Epicurus’ students, Timocrates of Lampsacus, would later turn against the school and publish
a screed against the school’s founder, accusing him of not being an Athenian citizen,
of having a variety of character flaws, and of frequent vomiting due to gluttony. On
the other hand, a later Epicurean named Diogenes of Oenoanda claims to have
found true happiness by following Epicurus’ teachings. He at least found riches, as he commissioned the construction of a 260-foot wall and plaza on which he
inscribed the central tenets of Epicureanism so that others could gain from what he
had learned. About a third of this structure survives today on the southern coast of
Turkey. With such a divide in opinion among those that studied it, we might reasonably wonder what Epicurean thought consists in.
 
As mentioned above, Epicurus studied under atomists as well as Platonists.
The atomist influence is felt strongly in his metaphysical picture. Indeed, Epicurus
contends that there, at bottom, only atoms and void. Atoms must exist because there we can see that ordinary objects are composed of various elements and there must be
some physical foundation upon which these constitutive elements are built. On the
other hand, there must be void because objects move. If the universe was completely
and densely packed with atoms, then there would be no space which objects could move into. While we have already seen this basic picture articulated in the Greek
tradition by the presocratic atomists like Democritus and Leucippus, Epicurus does
develop the model further. On Epicurus’ account, we can also say that the universe is
infinite. In defense of this, Epicurus asks us to imagine traveling to the end of a finite
universe. In this case, we should be able to go all the way out to the furthest point, push our hand out past the boundary, and thereby extend the universe. Since this
task could be repeated infinitely, there is no effective limit to the size of the universe.
Thus, Epicureanism posits an infinite universe filled with infinite void and an
equally infinite number of atoms.
 
Epicurus develops this atomic model further. Atomists have long talked
about atoms moving through space, but the details of this movement are hard to
work out, given that it wasn’t possible to see them. Epicurus thinks that the
 
185 movement of atoms can be determined through reason alone. Here, he tells us that
atoms strive ever downwards due to their weight. That physical substances move
downwards when left to their own devices can be seen in the fact that regular objects
made of atoms move toward in accordance with gravity. However, if this is the complete model of the movements of the atoms, then it leaves little room for our
choices. The atomist Ājīvika school of ancient India was led to deny the existence of
free-will on the basis of their view. If all there is is atoms and void, then everything in
existence is subject to the laws of physics. These laws will determine how the atoms
move (downward) which will, in turn, determine what chemical elements emerge where and when. These chemicals will determine facts about biochemistry and,
ultimately, biology. This allows us to draw a straight line from the movements of the
atoms (which are determined) to our mental life (where the mind is determined by
the biochemical brain). The Roman Epicurean Lucretius argued that since this model suggests that everything is determined, and we know from experience that we
have choice, then this model must be wrong. This problem is solved with the
introduction of the Epicurean concept of the swerve. Here, atoms are suggested to
turn sideways occasionally and randomly while falling downward. The introduction of randomness introduces an indeterminate element to the laws of physics, and the
Epicureans hold that human freedom emerges from this picture. Their solution to
the problem of free-will, which answers that humans are free in virtue of the world
being undetermined, can be called libertarianism.
 
Beyond this, Epicurus is notable for being among the first to defend the
identity theory of mind. On this position, mental events are identical to events in the brain. For instance, we might think that things like pain just are particular
patterns of neurons firing in the brain. Here, to be in pain is to be experiencing that
particular brain activity and to experience that brain activity would be to be in pain. It is an identity theory because the corresponding mental and physical events are
identical to one another. It should be no surprise that Epicurus was driven to such a
view, given his model of reality. If all there is is atoms and void, then we are
composed of atoms and there must then be some atomic correlate to what we experience in our mind. This view leads the Epicureans to a further claim about the
afterlife. Plato’s dualism had allowed for him to hold that the mind could survive
after death. Since the mental is not identical to the physical, one could be destroyed
 
186 while the other persists. Thus, by drawing the mental together with the physical,
Epicurus endorses annihilationism as a response to the problem of life after death.
 
When it comes to matters of epistemology, the Epicureans are critical of the
Cyrenaics. The two schools both place great importance on perception as a source of
knowledge. For the Cyrenaic school, it was the only source, as we can only truly have knowledge of the way that things appear to us. While at one level, this is a skeptical
position, it is also a form of empiricism. Empiricism is the philosophical position
that all knowledge is derived from the senses.36 Epicurus follows the Cyrenaics in
their empiricism, but ultimately concludes that experience can teach us much more than merely how things appear to us. When we use sense perception properly, we
can have actual knowledge about the objects which cause these perceptions. To
answer the skeptic, Epicurus has three arguments. First, if it were really true that we
can have no knowledge of anything, then we would have no reason to engage in any action. Why bother getting out of bed in the morning if you can’t be justified in even
thinking there is a bed to get out of. Accordingly, the position is unsustainable.
Second, the skeptic believes that we can’t know anything and that there is no truth of
the matter concerning the outside world. However, from where did the skeptic derive their concept of knowledge or truth? These concepts are not mere
appearances, so we must be able to infer something about them somehow. Finally,
the skeptical position is ultimately self-defeating. The skeptic claims to know that we
can’t know anything. Yet, how can we know that skepticism is true if skepticism is true?
 
Finally, we have arrived at the ethical theory of the Epicureans. We have
already mentioned that Epicurus and his followers were associated with the egoistic
hedonism of the Cyrenaic school. This wasn’t entirely wrong. Epicurus did endorse
egoistic hedonism as the key to attaining ataraxia, but his account departs from that of the Cyrenaics. The primary difference is that the Cyrenaics esteemed immediate
sensory pleasures above all else. By contrast, the Epicureans argue that mental
pleasures are superior to the pleasures of the body, and that long-term pleasure
should be maximized and prioritized when the two come into conflict. This is not
 
36 Empiricism will become a very popular theory during early modern times. More can be read about this in the “The Empiricists” chapter. 
 
187 just an ethical ideal, however. Epicurus also endorses psychological hedonism. This is the position that all human action is ultimately motivated by the pursuit of
pleasure or the avoidance of pain. True altruism or acting solely out of duty (even
when it runs contrary to our interest) is neither possible nor desirable. Instead, our choice is limited to one of pursuing short-term and momentary pleasures which are
immediate or putting them off to achieve greater and more sophisticated pleasures.
Epicurus ultimately advocated for the latter. Philosophy, the study of it and
discussions about it were key. Indeed, deep philosophical friendships were so
important for the Epicureans that they argued that friendship was the most essential form of human relation, valuable above and beyond things like romantic love.
Philodemus, another Roman Epicurean, illustrates the extent to which the school
emphasizes mental pleasure in two ways. First, Philodemus went so far as to argue
against music and music education on the basis that it distracts from learning philosophy (the ultimate source of mental pleasure). This hardline position
demonstrates the real divide between the Epicurean approach and the Cyrenaic view
which it was often conflated with.37 Second, there is Philodemus’ succinct statement
of the four cures of Epicureanism. These are the four secrets to a good life:
 
1.   Do not fear God.
2.   Do not fear death.
3.   What is pleasurable is easy to attain.
4.   What is painful is easy to endure.
 
The Stoics 
 
The Stoic school takes its name from the Stoa Polikile (‘painted porch’) in the Agora in Athens. Philosophers would often gather in the Agora to debate, and
the Stoa was where Zeno of Citium led his followers. As his name would suggest,
Zeno was born in Citium (in present day Cyprus). While it is possible that he was of
Greek ancestry, most historians believe he was a Phoenician (in modern day Lebanon
 
37 He was also a fierce critic of the Aristotelian philosopher of music Archestratus, who is discussed in a footnote in the “The Neoplatonists” section of this chapter. 
 
188 and Syria). According to one story, Zeno consulted the oracle at Delphi at a young
age, but whereas the oracle told Socrates no one was wiser, she told Zeno that he
‘ought to take on the complexion of the dead’. He interpreted this to mean that he
should study the ancients, and he found his calling in studying philosophy. Zeno took up studying philosophy in Athens, where he garnered a reputation as modest,
earnest, and gloomy. Despite amassing considerable wealth while working as a
bookseller, he was not inclined to live lavishly and instead taught students at the
Stoa. According to the ancient historian Diogenes Laertius, Zeno is said to have died
after tripping while leaving the Stoa. Falling, he broke his toe, hit the ground with his fist, and held his breath until he was dead.
 
Stoic philosophers often (and famously) compare philosophy to an egg,
with logic, ethics, and physics representing different parts. However, due to an
ancient misunderstanding in what parts of the egg serves which function, it might be more confusing to modern audiences if this analogy is recounted accurately here.
Instead, we might think of the Stoic picture of philosophy as akin to an orchard.
Logic is the fence which protects the entire enterprise, and which defines its
boundaries. Meanwhile. physics is the soil which serves as a foundation, and which provides nutrients. Finally, ethics is the fruit which motivates us to build the orchard
in the first place. In this way, the Stoic view is that philosophy is fundamentally a
practical project. On the one hand, if we want to grow apples well then, we need to
understand and monitor the conditions of the soul. On the other hand, without any desire to produce anything, it makes little sense to study the soil at all. The Stoics call
these three fields the topoi, and they provide their own account of each topos.
 
As we have already seen, the reliability of perception and the possibility of
knowledge are hot topics in Hellenistic philosophy. Stoicism treats epistemology
and, subsequently, perception as a subfield of logic. Here, the Stoics edge closer to the Epicureans than the Cyrenaics, though it is an empiricist school like the others.
The Epicureans have already argued that global skepticism is untenable, and that
perception is the path towards knowledge of that world. The Stoics will now provide
us with an answer to how and when perception can lead to knowledge. To do so,
they introduce the concept of cataleptic impressions. These are sensory impressions (appearances) which meet three criteria. First, they must come from
something existent. This allows Stoics like Zeno of Citium to distinguish between
 
189 perception (which can lead to knowledge) and hallucination (which can’t).
However, it is not enough to say that the thing we are perceiving exists. To say that it
‘comes from’ the existing thing is to suggest a causal relationship between the thing
and our perception. We see a poodle because the actual poodle impressed itself upon our senses. The actual dog is not just the basis for the content of our perception, but
the cause of it altogether. It is in virtue of this causation that the perception takes on
the character of the object we perceive. Second, they must accord with the existing
thing. By contrast, one can’t come to knowledge when the perception which forms
the belief doesn’t match up with the thing we are perceiving. That is, it does us no good to perceive a cat if we perceive it to be a dog, even if that cat actually exists.
Finally, these appearances must be ‘clear and distinct’.38 Clarity, here, means that the
sensory impression represents the entirety of the thing it represents. Meanwhile, an
impression is distinct when the thing it is representing is the only thing capable of causing such an impression. In the case of clarity, your perception of a square is clear
if you can discern from it all of the aspects of the square. In the case of distinctness,
the impression is only distinct if it rules out the possibility that the square is, in fact, a
mere rectangle. When all three of these criteria are brought together, the impression is cataleptic, and when we affirm a cataleptic impression, we have genuine
knowledge on the Stoic account.
 
The second topos, physics, is of considerable importance to the Stoics.
Ultimately, their ethical view is teleological like Aristotle’s. That is, what it means to live a good life is a matter of living according to our nature. Accordingly, we must
understand the natural world before we can turn to the topic of ethics. Here, the
Stoics are, like the Epicureans, materialists. What is real is physical and what is
physical is the extent of what is real. However, this does not drive the Stoics to deny
the existence of God or of a soul. Presocratic pluralists saw the four elements as principles of the universe and Thales saw only water. The Stoics, by contrast, see two
principles: God and matter. On this account, God is the logos (or rational principle)
of the universe and is contained and embodied entirely within it. God’s rationality
orders the universe, and the universe is fully determined by that order. The Epicureans were pushed to deny causal determinism because it would entail that
 
38 These terms will also be used by René Descartes, but to mean something different. More can be read about his account in the “Rene Descartes” chapter.  
 
190 free-will doesn't exist. However, the Stoics believe that they can reconcile
determinism with moral responsibility and, in doing so, address the problem of free-
will. The Stoic answer to this challenge is, perhaps, most fully expressed in the work
of Chrysippus. However, before we can engage with Chrysippus’ arguments for free-will, we should understand why the Stoics thought that the soul was material.
 
Cleanthes, who took control of the Stoa after the death of Zeno, tells us that the soul is material for at least two reasons. First, parents pass down mental traits
as well as physical ones. Since the parents create the child physically, the soul which
inherits their traits must, itself, be physical. Second, there is a deep interaction between the body and the mind. For instance, when the body is injured, the soul
feels pain. Likewise, when the soul is in anguish, it can manifest physical symptoms.
These two reasons drive Cleanthes to hold that the soul is material. Yet, the
materiality of the soul and the determinism that comes with the Stoic conception of God are not sufficient to have the school deny the existence of free-will. As
mentioned above, the question is taken up by Chrysippus, who inherits the Stoa
from Cleanthes, and who is credited with most fully working out the details of the
Stoic system. Here, he distinguishes between physical causes which are sufficient to bring about their effects and causes that aren’t. The connection between this
distinction and free-will is illustrated in a famous example involving a cylinder and
cone. Chrysippus asks us to imagine a person pushing both objects so as to cause
them to roll down a hill. The cylinder will continue to roll until it reaches the bottom. However, given its shape, the cone will spin off sideways instead. This
difference is due to the difference in both objects’ natures. The same push was
sufficient to cause the cylinder to reach the bottom of the hill, but not sufficient to
cause the cone to do the same thing. The same rule applies to the various natures of
individual humans. The causal structure of the universe is completely determined, but our own natures will either assent to those causes or not. This is the essence of
free choice. Just as knowing something requires that we assent to the cataleptic
impressions which are caused by the outside world, the outside world can cause
certain desires within us, and which require our assent in order to bring about actions. We can call the view that causal determinism is compatible with free-will
‘compatibilism’. It will become a very popular view among philosophers as time
 
191 goes on. Yet, with this picture in mind, we might reasonably wonder which things
we should assent to.
 
Stoic ethics trends closer to Aristotle’s theory than to its fellow Hellenistic
rivals. For one, we have already seen that it is teleological in nature. Further than this,
however, it aims the good life at full-blooded eudaimonia rather than mere ataraxia. Also like Aristotle, Stoicism believes that the key to eudaimonia is living a life of
virtue. However, as promised, our own natures will provide us with insight into how
to live virtuously. Epicurus’ ethical theory concluded that we ought to be egoistic
hedonists on the basis of psychological hedonism. By contrast, Stoicism tells us that in addition to valuing 1) what is in our own interests, we also value 2) what is in the
interest of those close to us, and 3) use our rational capacity to navigate life. With
this psychological model in tow, we can now say more about virtue. Because we
value ourselves, those we identify with, and rationality as a means to achieving our ends, the virtues are the traits which are conducive to these interests. In order to
realize our own goals, we need temperance and courage (which were also important
on Aristotle’s account). Likewise, in order to properly take care of others we need a
sense of justice. Finally, practical wisdom is the solution to realizing these things in life (another component brought on from Aristotle). Thus, we ought to use reason
to assent to what is virtuous and not what is merely dictated by emotion. Life may
make us angry, but command over our emotions, and the choice not to assent to it,
will lead us to virtuous action. The Stoics call this command over the emotions
apatheia. This, along with ataraxia, are the building blocks of eudaimonia.
 
The world view articulated by Zeno of Citium and, eventually, Cleanthes
and Chrysippus gained considerable popularity in the Hellenistic period through
late antiquity. Indeed, the doctrine of accepting the conditions that the world
affords us and controlling what we can change spoke to later Roman Stoics like
Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius. Epictetus, who was a former slave, was well aware of how little can be within our control in life. Unhappiness, for Epictetus, is rooted in
our desires not being in accordance with nature. Slavery is in our inability to control
those desires. We sometimes want our lives to be radically different than they are; we want to be rich or famous and we aren’t. However, that life is unfair does not make
you mad. You are mad because you assent to the emotion as it is caused in you rather
than let it pass. This doctrine appealed to Epictetus as a former slave but, at the other
 
192 end of the spectrum, it also appealed to the Roman emperor and Stoic Marcus 
Aurelius. Aurelius’ life is one characterized by an enormous sense of duty, and the relationship between this and his Stoicism is detailed in his diary, published as the
Meditations. There, Aurelius makes clear that determinism is only a problem for free-will insofar as we let emotions control us. They are caused by events in the world
and, in this way, acting in accordance with them is to act mechanically. True
freedom, he says, lies in controlling one’s emotions and acting in accordance with
reason (and the duties it reveals).
 
The Cynics 
 
If the Stoics are often remembered for the manner of their death, with Zeno of Citium holding his breath until he died and Chrysippus dying from laughter after
hearing his own joke, the philosophers who make up the cynic school are equally
remembered for the way they lived. Philosophy in the Hellenistic period was
exceptionally practical, and metaphysical theorizing was generally limited to what might be helpful in bringing about happiness. However, the cynics and, later, the
skeptics took an even more practical view of what philosophy should be. Instead of
theorizing with the good life in mind, the cynics saw being a philosopher and living a
good life as identical propositions. Their view is not expressed in prose or written dialogues, but in the stories, we have from their lives.
 
The cynic school is said to have been founded by Antisthenes, who was so enamored with Socrates that he traveled over five miles a day to study under him.
Antisthenes would later develop his own school at the Cynosarges, a gymnasium for
poorer students and those born of foreign mothers. He dressed simply, with only a cloak and staff, and the followers he attracted took the style as their uniform.
Eventually these philosophers became known as the cynics, in honor of Antisthenes’
nickname, which means ‘dog’. Theories abound as to why Antisthenes and the
cynics were called dogs, but none have fully settled the matter. In either event, we are told that he wrote prolifically and that his writing was stylish, yet none survives to
this day. However, unlike many of the other scholars we have discussed whose
 
193 writings didn’t survive, this was an intentional act on Antisthenes’ part. It is said that
he burned his writings after meeting Socrates. If Socrates was able to communicate
his teachings in the way that he lived, then Antisthenes would also. In this way, his
teachings remain because of the profound impact they had on his followers.
 
First among these teachings is the primacy of virtue. Virtue alone contributes to the nobility of a person and virtue is attainable by anyone. However
simple, this view is somewhat radical in its implications when taken seriously. It
means that we should afford no special respect to kings or the like, and that we
regard the poorest among us as equals. Such an idea would have been even more shocking in Hellenistic Greece. We have already seen the latter belief manifest in the
style of Antisthenes’ teachings (focusing on instructing poorer students), while the
former belief will be most expressed in the exploits of Antisthenes’ student Diogenes
of Sinope.  Another of cynicism’s central tenets is that self-sufficiency is the key to a good life. Accordingly, cynic philosophers tended to adopt the view that the more
one has, the more one has to lose. This belief drove them to adopt ascetic lifestyles
not unlike what we have seen in the śramaṇa movement within Indian philosophy.
However, it took significant physical training in order to withstand the temptations of an easy life outfitted with the comforts we have come to expect. Cynical training
included things like walking barefoot through snow, rolling in hot sand, and
depriving oneself of clothes and money. With the freedom that this entailed, the
cynics felt empowered to hold a mirror to their society and to, hopefully, shock the Greek world into a life of true virtue.
 
Antisthenes’ student, Diogenes of Sinope is, perhaps, the most famous of the cynics. Diogenes’ father was a banker in Sinope (in modern day Turkey) and
Diogenes is said to have fled to Athens after causing problems for his father by
defacing currency. Consulting with the Oracle at Delphi, he was advised to deface currency. Having already done that, and to mixed results, Diogenes interpreted the
comment to mean that he ought to deface the political or social currency of his
society: custom. In and around Athens, Diogenes was known to have lived outside in
a large clay jar used for storing wine and to have lived with very little. He, like Antisthenes, wore a simple cloak and carried only a staff and bowl. Once, upon
seeing a child drink water by cupping their hands, Diogenes threw away the bowl,
not to be outdone in modesty by a child. This story is fairly representative of the
 
194 cynic attitude toward wealth and material possessions. Diogenes is said to have once
been invited into the home of a rich man, who showed him all of the riches and
niceties he had accumulated. Upon seeing these things, Diogenes spat in the man’s
face because everything else was “too nice to spit on.”39 This tendency, towards self-denial with regards to worldly things, extended to power as well. Another story has
Diogenes being visited by Alexander the Great. Having studied philosophy
considerably, the emperor was inclined to do the great Diogenes any favor he might
want. In response, Diogenes merely told Alexander to stop blocking his sunlight.
This is supposed to have so endeared Diogenes to the emperor that Alexander once declared that if he couldn’t be the emperor, he would want to be Diogenes. In turn,
Diogenes is said to have retorted that that makes perfect sense, as if he couldn’t be
himself, he would want to be Diogenes too.
 
The total independence that cynics gained from their practices allowed them to achieve some critical distance from political and religious life. They are
supposed to have been the originators of cosmopolitanism, the philosophical
position that we should have no special relationship to our country or to our fellow
citizens. Instead, cynics like Diogenes declared themselves citizens of the world. The religious beliefs and customs of Greek and Roman society drew considerable
criticism from the cynics as well. Antisthenes was once told by a priest that riches
awaited the converted in the afterlife. To which Antisthenes replied, “why don’t you
die then?”40 The same is true for Diogenes, who once saw offerings being left at a temple. These offerings were given in thanks to the gods by those that had survived a
natural disaster. Upon seeing this, Diogenes pointed out that there would be more
offerings if they were given by those the gods didn’t save.
 
Despite their sometimes scandalous behavior, rival schools did not judge the
cynics as harshly as they did the Cyrenaics and Epicureans. This is because of their relationship towards pleasure. Regular Athenians and philosophers alike could see
something good in the cynics’ commitment to wisdom and virtue, even if they
disagreed with them about the nature of both. The hedonistic schools, however,
 
39 Peter Adamson, Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds: A History of Philosophy Without Any Gaps, Volume 2. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015): 13. 40 Adamson, Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds, 13.  
 
195 esteemed pleasure above all else, and this was unconscionable. We have already seen
that Diogenes trained himself to survive on little and looked down on the pursuit of
money and luxuries. The same was true of other pleasures as well. We are told that he
survived on simple meals of lentils and that he once threw out a dessert he found mixed in with his breakfast, declaring ‘steer clear of tyrants!’ However, the cynics
weren’t averse to all pleasure. For instance, Diogenes was known to engage in public
sexual self-gratification, and to have defended this act by saying “I only wish I could
get rid of hunger by rubbing my belly.”41 These acts certainly shocked Athenian
society, but the difference for the cynics lies in the distinction between natural pleasures and unnatural pleasures. The cynics did not look down on pleasure in
general, but on those pleasures that weren’t easily attainable. Diogenes and
Antisthenes follow Aristotle in thinking that the good life is a matter of living in
accordance with our nature, and in thinking that the ultimate good of life will be attainable by anyone, regardless of their social status or circumstance. However,
where Aristotle took this to mean we ought to live a life of rational self-cultivation
and refinement, the cynics took this to mean that we should aim for a life free from
the desires imposed by society. The natural desires, however, are fair game and are compatible with a life of ataraxia.
 
The final cynic figures worth mentioning are Crates of Thebes and
Hipparchia of Maroneia. Crates of Thebes was a student of Diogenes’ who gave up
considerable wealth to become a philosopher and to survive as a beggar. He was nicknamed ‘the door-opener’ because he is said to have invited himself into any
house and to have been welcome in all of them. He is notable for having taught Zeno
of Citium, who founded the Stoic school. Having studied under Diogenes (who ate
only lentils) and having himself written a book extolling the virtues of eating only
lentils, Crates instructed Zeno to carry a bowl of lentils through a marketplace. However, Zeno hid the bowl for fear of embarrassment by association with the
cynics. Upon seeing this, Crates smashed the bowl with his cane and Zeno fled the
marketplace in embarrassment and covered in lentils. Despite Zeno’s inability to
embrace the shamelessness of cynic life, his own Stoic school would still be influenced by the cynics. The influence can be seen in their extolling of virtue but
 
41 Adamson, Philosophy in the Hellenistic and Roman Worlds, 15. 
 
196 also in their deriding of desires. Desiring what is not determined by nature is the
source of unhappiness for the Stoics, and the cynic position may be thought of as a
more extreme version of that.
 
Hipparchia of Maroneia was the sister of one of Crates’ wealthy
students. Upon meeting the teacher, she was so impressed that she too renounced her wealth and pursued the life of a cynic philosopher. Crates and Hipparchia were
married and their marriage was uncommon in the ancient Greek world due to its
foundation in love and mutual respect rather than in alliance building and custom.
Famously, they followed in Diogenes’ footsteps by engaging in public intercourse in an attempt to shock their fellow Athenians into reflection. Of course, ordinary
Athenians thought this behavior wrong, because it violated custom, but how could
what is natural be wrong? By contrast, the cynics see the unnatural pursuit of wealth
and esteem to be wrong. Thus, through their shocking behavior, the cynics hoped to open up Athenian society to a more robust reflection on virtue and its relationship
to custom.
 
The Skeptics 
 
The Hellenistic schools we have discussed so far have, despite all being
empiricists, taken up a range of views on the problem of knowledge. At one end of the extreme is the Cyrenaics, who think we can only have knowledge of the
appearances of things and not the things which cause those appearances. The Stoics,
meanwhile, think we can have real knowledge of things but only in the case of
cataleptic impressions. Finally, the Epicureans take a broader view and think we can
have knowledge beyond that of mere appearances and the objects associated with cataleptic impressions, even if all knowledge ultimately still must be rooted in the
senses. The skeptic school takes up the position at the opposite end of this spectrum
from the Epicureans. The school’s founder, Pyrrho, is the first in the Greek
tradition since Socrates to not have been profoundly influenced by him. Instead, Pyrrho became interested in philosophy while on campaign with Alexander the
Great. Alexander’s military exploits took him (and Pyrrho) as far as India, where
 
197
Pyrrho was introduced to the gymnosophists. This is the Greek term for the Indian philosophers Hellenistic Greeks encountered in their travels with Alexander the
Great. They were known to have advocated skeptical positions and to have engaged
in seemingly extreme ascetic practices. Given the influence that these thinkers had on people like Pyrrho, and the later arguments Pyrrho and his followers would give to
defend their position, many today think that the gymnosophists were likely members
of the Ajñāna school of Indian philosophy.42 This is because, like Ajñāna, Pyrrho’s
school endorses a form of skepticism. Also like the Ajñāna school, Pyrrho’s
skepticism is more global than the cynics’, which was focused primarily on Athenian politics, custom, and religion. Ultimately, Pyrrho contends that reality itself is
indeterminate. There simply is no fact of the matter about the way things are.
Accordingly, we are never justified in claiming that we have knowledge. This means
that not only are all of the philosophical ideas we have discussed so far not true, they are also not false. Instead, the skeptics contend that the only tenable position is to
withhold judgment on all matters.43 
 
After Pyrrho, Carneades emerged as the next important figure in the
skeptic school. Carneades was born in Cyrene just like the less radical skeptics who make up the Cyrenaic school. Early in his life, however, he made his way from his
native Libya to Athens where he studied at, and eventually was put in charge of,
Plato’s Academy. Famously, Carneades was once invited from Athens to Rome on a
sort of diplomatic mission. While there, Carneades earned a reputation for an impassioned speech he gave extolling the virtues of Roman justice. Word of his skills
as an orator spread and he returned to give another speech the next day, and this time
to an even larger crowd. This time, however, he spent the entire speech refuting the
arguments that he had given the day before. Romans in the audience, having not
lived through the sophists of Socrates’ time, were shocked. In doing this, Carneades was attempting to demonstrate that the concept of justice was merely a tool used to
 
42 The skeptics also share a striking resemblance to the Mādhyamaka school in Indian philosophy. However, Given that the school’s founder, Nāgārjuna, was a contemporary of much later skeptic philosophers, it is more likely that Mādhyamaka and the skeptics share a common influence in Ajñāna than it is that either school influenced the other directly. 43 Pyrrho would later serve as a profound influence for the French Renaissance philosopher Michel de Montaigne, who defended skepticism in his own time.   
 
198 regulate society, and that we should (appropriately enough) be skeptical of those that
make claims about justice. Such a move drew the negative attention of Roman
authorities, who thought Carneades’ ideas dangerous, and he was promptly sent
back to Athens.
 
Beyond his claims about justice, Carneades is also remembered for
advocating for an epistemic position known as probabilism. This is the view that, given the fundamental indeterminacy of reality (as advocated for by Pyrrho), we
should merely aim to hold the beliefs most likely to be true rather than those we can
be certain of. This is a stark contrast to Plato’s ambitious epistemology. It focused on knowledge as something perfect, absolute, and eternal. Carneades’ probabilism tells
us, rather, that we get what we get, and we don’t throw a fit. Since Carneades takes it
that certain knowledge is impossible, we must suffice with what is likely. Critics of
skepticism had argued that it would lead to the end of all action; if we can’t know whether our boss or workplace are even real, why bother getting out of bed to go to
work? Probabilism tells us that, while we can’t be certain of these things, that doesn’t
mean they aren’t likely to be true. The likeliness of these things being true is
sufficient, on Carneades’ account, to motivate us to act (and thus avoid the problem of inaction).
 
Finally, Carneades is also strongly associated with a particular famous
thought experiment in ethics.44 This case, sometimes called the plank of 
Carneades, involves two survivors of a shipwreck. Swimming in the water, and
miles from the shore, both are desperate to find something to hang on to. Between them is a floating plank of wood. The first survivor gets to the plank and begins to
hang on. Knowing that they will drown if they do nothing, and that there is not
room on the plank for both, the second survivor pushes the first off of the plank and
grabs a hold of it. However, while the second survivor has prevented themselves from drowning, in doing so, they have also caused the first to drown. The question,
 
44 Though this thought experiment is referred to as the ‘plank of Carneades’ and is attributed to Carneades by the 3rd century Christian author Lactantius (in his work The Divine Institutes), the Roman statesman Marcus Tullius Cicero (in his De Officiis) writes that it appears in a now lost work titled “On Moral Duties”, written by the Stoic philosopher Hecato of Rhodes (who apparently wrote extensively on questions of applied ethics and justice). 
 
199 then, is whether, after being rescued, the second survivor should be tried for murder.
On the one hand, they are certainly the immediate cause of the first survivor’s death,
and the first survivor didn’t deserve to die. On the other hand, the second survivor
acted in their own defense (even if the first survivor wasn’t intentionally endangering them).
 
Last among the major members of the skeptic school is Sextus Empiricus. Little is known about his life other than that he was likely born in either Rome or
Alexandria (in modern day Egypt). This shift, away from thinkers born and based in
Athens and Cyrene and towards those in Alexandria, will also be seen in the last Hellenistic school we will discuss, the Neoplatonists, and represents the early steps in
the greater Mediterranean philosophical tradition’s eastward drift. Empiricus rounds
out the skeptic school by giving us something of the skeptic view on ethics. While
the ideas he expresses may predate him (being found in Pyrrho and Carneades), he illustrates the skeptic account of the good life quite well. Like many of the other
Hellenistic schools, the skeptics were concerned with achieving ataraxia. If we are
never justified in claiming that we have knowledge, we are also never justified in
being upset. To be upset is to pass judgment on the way things are, but that would require that we know what way things ought to be. This is the key to achieving
imperturbability for the skeptics. Sextus Empiricus also defends skepticism against
the charges of it leading to inaction, but does so in a way that differs from Carneades’
probabilism. Here, Empiricus tells us that habit is the key to action rather than the likelihood of belief. Often, we don't get out of bed because we believe that the boss is
counting on us or because we believe the workplace is where we should be. Rather,
we get out of bed in the morning out of habit, with no real conscious thoughts. We
simply do because we have. This is Empiricus’ solution to skepticism’s inaction
problem.
 
The Neoplatonists 
 
While Carneades was, at one point, in charge of Plato’s Academy, this does
not mean that skepticism replaced Platonism during this era. Later advocates for
 
200
Plato’s views form the Neoplatonist school, and they ensured that his ideas remained
a significant force through the Hellenistic period, the time of the Roman empire,
and into the time of the Byzantine empire. Of course, these thinkers probably would
have thought of themselves simply as Platonists, rather than Neoplatonists. The term ‘Neoplatonism’ is one invented by historians of philosophy to describe the further
development and modification of Plato’s theories which was undertaken by later
scholars. These same historians of philosophy tend to count the work of Plotinus as
the beginning of a distinct Neoplatonist school.
 
Plotinus was born somewhere in Roman controlled Egypt, though it is not clear whether he himself was Egyptian, Roman, or Greek.  He took up the study of
philosophy in Alexandria at a relatively late age (28) and eagerly joined a military
campaign into Persia hoping to learn about Persian and Indian philosophy. After
this effort quickly fizzled out, Plotinus traveled to Rome, where he gained the respect of Emperor Gallienus. Given his commitment to Platonism, Plotinus
leveraged this relationship in an effort to build a city by and for philosophers which
would be run in accordance with Plato’s ideals. This, too, was a failure, and Plotinus
lived out the remainder of his days in the site in Sicily where the city would have been established. There, at an old age, he began to write, but was unable to edit his
work due to poor eyesight. Instead, these writings were compiled and edited by
Plotinus’ student, Porphyry (who would himself become an important figure due
to his attempt to reconcile the metaphysics of Plato with Aristotle’s logic). In this work, called the Enneads, Plotinus provides us with a metaphysical picture which,
while attempting to be consistent with the ideas of Plato, represents a unique
contribution to philosophy.
 
Plotinus’ most significant idea is also among the most difficult to grasp. At
its most straightforward, Plotinus draws together the idea of reality and the concept of unity so that the more unified an object is, the more real it is. Here, an example
may be helpful. Consider a daisy. This flower is one thing in the sense that all of its
parts work together so as to pull in the same direction: towards its growth and
development. The same is true for the parts of an animal. Less unified than this are things like forests and nations. Indeed, there is some sense in which the parts work
together, but there is another sense in which the unity of the forest is merely a
description we impose on it from the outside. From the inside (that is, from the
 
201 perspective of the trees which make it up), the forest is really a competition between
various animals and plants. The same is true for the people who make up a nation. In
this way, we might be tempted to think that the forest and the nation, as unified
things, are less real than the flower. At least, that is what Plotinus is hoping we think. If this is right, then we can track a thing’s level of reality by tracking its unity. What’s
more, unity is merely an expression of harmony. The forest seems less unified than
the flower because its parts are not in harmony with each other the way that the
flower’s are. Plotinus, like many of the ancient philosophers, observes that the
universe itself is ordered, with things maintaining their identity and developing seemingly according to a plan, and this observation causes him to ask what is
responsible for that unity.
 
Here, Plotinus identified the principle of unity in the universe with Plato’s
form of the good. After all, whatever the source of the world’s unity is, it must itself be unified, and physical objects are composed of matter and parts. On its face, the
form of the good doesn’t seem to permit itself to be broken down into parts. The
problem with this is that once we start to talk about this principle, the less unified it
sounds. If we were to say that it is good, we distinguish it from its goodness. Its goodness is, rather, a distinct property of it. The same can be said of its beauty and
even of its unity. This drives Plotinus to consider the principle ineffable, or beyond
description. He calls this principle the One. While Aristotle thought that the final
cause of the universe was pure actuality, Plotinus takes it that the One is pure potentiality. To be actually one way or another is to be limited. The One can’t
actually be large without ceasing to be small. Instead, it must be both large and small
in potentiality (along with every other description we can offer). This account of the
principle of the universe can be summed up neatly in Plotinus’ declaration that “the
One is all things, and no one of them.”45 
 
Beyond Plotinus, there are a number of other thinkers in this tradition
worth considering. In his own time, Plato had followed in Pythagoras’ footsteps by
taking up a number of women as students, and Neoplatonism reflects this. For
instance, philosophers like Aedesia, Axiothea of Phlius, Lastheneia of Mantinea, Sosipatra, and Theodora of Emesa count themselves among the Hellenistic and

202
Roman Platonists. Unfortunately, none of the work of these thinkers survives to us
today, and we don’t know what specific doctrines they may have contributed to the
school. Nevertheless, we can discuss, with some detail, the work of Ptolemais of 
Cyrene. While, strictly speaking, she is most often regarded as a Pythagorean rather than a Platonist, there are still a few reasons why she is worth discussing here. For one
thing, Plato and Pythagoras’ schools have long had a deep connection, with both
centering mathematics in their worldviews, both emphasizing a philosophical role
for women, and with a possible historical connection in Plato’s mother. Further,
Ptolemais pushes her Pythagoreanism in the direction of Plato by attempting to strike a middle position between the Pythagoreans of her own day and the
Aristotelians, thus occupying a space we might expect Platonists to inhabit.
 
Beyond the fact that, as her name suggests, she was born in Cyrene, little else
is known of her life. Instead, she is remembered for her views on music. As we saw, Plato was skeptical of the arts and artists. Socrates denied that they even had much
insight into their own works, much less the world. Plato also worried about their
ability to lead people astray. After all, it was the poet Meletus who brought the
charges against Socrates which ultimately led to his death. However, Plato did appreciate the power of math. Pythagoras had already linked together mathematics
and music in his own time. According to the Pythagoreans, even the planets were
supposed to behave according to the ‘harmony of the spheres’, which was
describable in terms of mathematics. Accordingly, Hellenistic Pythagoreans saw musical notes as related in their mathematical proportions. The intervals between the
different notes were expressions of these proportions and those intervals fixed the
identity of the notes. This means that, what it means to, for instance, play an A is to
play a note which stands in the proper mathematical relationship to the other notes.
Good music, then, is defined by the beauty of the mathematical harmony underlying the melody. By contrast, the Aristotelians carried on Aristotle’s empiricist legacy by
placing sense experience front and center. Music, for them, is ultimately a matter of
how things sound. The ear, not mathematical reasoning, is the judge of good music
and of harmony.46 Ptolemais tries to unify the two approaches. She argues that what
 
46 As we have already seen, this view was defended by Aristotle’s student Theophrastus. However, it was also endorsed by other peripatetics, such as Aristoxenus (who also argued 
203 is perceived by the ear (as Pythagoras argued) is unified and perceptible due to reason
(as revealed through mathematics), and that reason alone (without starting in the
perception of sound) is not sufficient to generate beautiful music. Accordingly, the
identity of the notes and the goodness of music requires both perception and mathematics.
 
In the time after Plotinus, Porphyry, and Ptolemais of Cyrene, a number of
thinkers would develop Platonism further. Hypatia would adopt Plotinus’
Neoplatonism and use it to make advancements in mathematics. Meanwhile,
Asclepigenia further developed the school’s ethical theory, arguing that each person’s soul contained a part of the One and that union between the One and the
part contained in our soul is the key to happiness. However, the philosopher who
best embodies the direction that European philosophy was headed at the time is
Boethius. Boethius’s work attempts to synthesize the declining Platonism with the ascendent Christianity. Yet, it is a work called The Consolation of Philosophy, which is
his most influential.
 
The Great Schism had divided the Roman empire into an eastern Byzantine
empire and Western Roman empire. While the Byzantine empire would remain for some time, the Western Roman Empire collapsed shortly before Boethius’ birth.
Now divided into a number of different kingdoms, Boethius rose to power as a
senator in the Ostrogothic kingdom in modern day Italy. However, his efforts to
expose corruption made him quite unpopular. Eventually, his enemies banded
together and got him sentenced to death on unjust charges. This context provided a backdrop for The Consolation of Philosophy, which was written in jail while Boethius
awaited his punishment. In the book, Boethius describes a fictional conversation
with ‘lady philosophy’. Boethius complains about the injustice of his circumstances
 
that knowledge of music is best obtained by listening rather than by practicing an instrument) and Archestratus (who argued that it is not sense perception of musical notes but, rather, subsequent reasoning on the basis of these perceptions, which ought to be the ultimate judge of harmony).  
 
204 and philosophy reassures him that a divine providence is at work in the world, which
the events in his life are subordinate to.47
 
Yet, if The Consolation of Philosophy is Boethius’ most influential work, it is
not his most influential contribution to philosophy. Instead, Boethius is credited
with re-raising an old problem in a way that causes it to occupy the attention of
philosophers for at least the next thousand years. That is the problem of universals. We technically first encountered this problem when we worked through
Plato’s theory of the forms. He had told us that universal concepts existed in a robust
way. In fact, their existence is so robust that it is greater even than our own. By contrast, Aristotle had placed the forms inside of the particulars through his doctrine
of substantial form. However, we have so far been concerned with the reality of
classes of particulars which are supposed to reflect the nature of those things (e.g.,
trees, poodles, circles, etc.) Boethius’ successors raise these same worries about properties generally. The problem of universals is the question of whether shared
properties (e.g., circular, tall, red, treeness, poodleness, etc.) are real in and of
themselves, or merely a product of language.
 
Outside of these philosophical contributions, Boethius’ life and work is emblematic of the direction in which European philosophy is headed because it
represents a movement away from Plato and towards Christianity. Later Medieval
European philosophers will put Christianity front and center. However, we have
already seen the intellectual capital of philosophy drift eastward from Athens to
Cyrene to Alexandria. This trend will continue in the next centuries, with Baghdad emerging as the dominant home of philosophy. Thus, in order to understand the
story of the tradition which is said to have begun with Thales and continued
through Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, we must travel to the Islamic world, where we
will spend the next 600 years.
 
47 Boethius’ work would later inspire the medieval Italian-born French philosopher and poet Christine de Pizan, who drew on The Consolation of Philosophy in her own virtue ethics.

Philosophy in the 
 
Islamic World 
 
While the Islamic world in general (and Baghdad in particular) did come to
be the home of intellectual life after the time of the Roman empire, philosophy was
not new to this part of the world. We mentioned the Great Forest Upanishad as one of the earliest entries into the world’s philosophical written record because it was
likely produced as early as 800 B.C.E. However, Babylonia can lay claim to an even
earlier instance. The “Babylonian Theodicy” is a philosophical hymn written by the
priest Saggil-kīnam-ubbib sometime around 1,000 B.C.E. This puts the text as far before the Great Forest Upanishad as that text is before Thales. In the hymn, one
character raises the problem of evil, or the question of how we can reconcile the existence of a good and just God with the evil and suffering in the world. The other
character, a friend, attempts to console the first by explaining that there is order and justice in the world because it is created by a divinity, even if we can’t always see it at
work in our lives. Yet, there is an earlier work still. In the 23rd century B.C.E., the
high priestess and daughter of the king Sargon of Akkad, Enheduanna, wrote what
may be not only the world’s oldest surviving written work of philosophy, but is also
the oldest surviving work by a named author. This text, The Exaltation of Inanna, takes the form of an epic poem in which the priestess asks Inanna, the goddess of
war, to intervene against a rebellion and in support of her father’s regime (but also to
deliver Enheduanna from exile). In the process of this, the text discusses the problem
of political authority, as well as the problem of social cohesion.
 
Even still, these early Babylonian texts aren’t the only written philosophy
from the region at that time. As we have already discussed, Zoroaster is likely among
 
209 the first to put forward philosophical theses that we can still recall, but whether they
are philosophy or prophecy is a matter of debate. In either case, philosophy
continued in the Islamic world long after the time of Enheduanna, Saggil-kīnam-
ubbib, and Zoroaster. Mani continued in the Persian philosophical prophetic tradition of Zoroaster as late as 277 C.E. His philosophical doctrine, maintained in
the religion which bears his name (Manichaeism), can be seen as a synthesis of
Christianity, Zoroastrianism, and Buddhism. In fact, the Neoplatonist Porphyry was
born in what is now modern-day Lebanon. Likewise, Porphyry’s student,
Iamblichus, was of Arab descent and lived in Roman occupied Syria. Iamblichus’s version of Neoplatonism contended that the natural world is entirely determined by
fate, and that only the divine realm is truly free. Yet, despite these earlier entries, we
focus now on the Islamic world because this is the time in which the region asserts
itself as the primary engine of intellectual progress in the world. Likewise, the philosophy that happens here and at this time will set the stage for further
developments in Europe and in Africa. This age of productivity and importance,
lasting from the early 600’s C.E. to the middle of the 1200’s, has come to be known
as the Islamic Golden Age.
 
While earlier prophets like Mani and Zoroaster did have a significant impact
on intellectual life in the Islamic World, the figure that looms the largest is the
prophet Muhammad. He was born around forty years after the death of Boethius,
and established Islam as a religious and political force in the region. By 632 C.E., Abu Bakr had secured power as Muhammad’s religious and political heir, and the
Rashidun Caliphate was established. With Rome in decay in the west, the former
Greek colonies in Northern Africa were left vulnerable to this new rising power. The
second (Umayyad) Caliphate grew substantially, taking in parts of Libya and Egypt
in the west and parts of Persia in the east. This brought Greek philosophical texts into the Islamic world, where they lay mostly dormant for the time. It wasn’t until
the caliph As-Saffāḥ overthrew the Umayyad dynasty and established the Abbasid
Caliphate that the groundwork was laid for the full exploration of Greek thought in
the region.
 
With as-Saffāḥ’s early death, control of the caliphate passed to al-Manṣūr,
his younger brother. Al-Manṣūr founded Baghdad and began the process of shifting
the capital of the Caliphate there. Al-Manṣūr’s eventual successor, al-Ma’mūn would
 
210 be the region’s greatest champion of knowledge. After a dream in which he was
visited by Aristotle and told that religion and philosophy were compatible, Al-
Ma’mūm saw an opening with the demise of the Library of Alexandria and began
amassing knowledge from the furthered reaches of the empire. This trove would eventually become Baghdad’s ‘House of Wisdom’ (‘Bayt Al-Ḥikmah’), the largest
library in the world. There, al-Ma’mūn would employ scores of translators and
scholars and finance expeditions to seek out mathematical knowledge from India
and medical knowledge from Greece. His appetite for knowledge was so strong that
he once sought and received copies of Greek mathematical texts as part of the negotiation of a military truce with the Byzantine empire.
 
In Baghdad, significant intellectual progress was made through this effort,
now referred to as the ‘Arabic translation movement’. Researchers expanded on the
works they translated and studied. Alchemy, algebra, and algorithms all take their English name from Arabic words because they were derived from Arabic texts and
the work of Arab scholars. In return, translators were paid handsomely. By some
estimates, their salaries were equivalent to those of today’s professional athletes. This
allowed science, mathematics, and philosophy to thrive throughout the Islamic world. This territory would eventually reach all the way across the Maghreb (the
Arab dominated regions of northwest Africa) and around to al-Andalus (in modern
day Spain). As we will see, the introduction of Arabic translations of Greek texts into
Spain played a large part in reintroducing ancient philosophy to Europe.
 
The most important part of Al-Ma’mūn’s translation movement, for our
purposes, was the establishment of the falsafa (meaning philosophy) tradition. Before this, there was already a scholarly tradition in the region known as kalām,
which might be equivalent to theology. Scholars of kalām began their inquiries with
the teachings of Muhammad and sought to work out their metaphysical and epistemological implications. However, this does not mean that it isn’t, at the same
time, Philosophy. As we saw in India) and will see in Medieval Europe), many
philosophers throughout history have used the doctrines of their religion as a starting
point. Likewise, scholars in the falsafa tradition also draw on religious doctrines as well. However, the falsafa tradition is distinguished from kalām primarily because of
its willingness to supplement these religious doctrines with ideas taken from Greek
philosophical sources. Likewise, they saw fit to address the questions that
 
211 philosophers had been concerned with which hadn’t occupied kalām scholars. While
they did often synthesize Islamic teachings with ancient philosophy, the results of
their inquiries are not merely a matter of rehashing existing ideas. They also strike
out in interesting new directions and build beyond the Greek sources they draw on. The first falsafa thinker to do this is Al-Kindī, who has come to be known as the
‘father of Arab philosophy’.
 
Al-Kindī
 
Al-Kindī (born Abū Yūsuf Yaʻqūb ibn ʼIsḥāq aṣ-Ṣabbāḥ al-Kindī) hailed
from the city of Kufa central Iraq. He takes his name from the Arab Kufa tribe,
which can trace its lineage back to the time of Muhammad. His father was well-connected, serving as the governor of Basra, and this allowed al-Kindī to travel to
Baghdad to continue his studies beyond what Basra would allow. There, he attracted
the attention of the caliph al-Ma’mūn, who put al-Kindī in charge of the Arabic
translation movement at the House of Wisdom. This meant that al-Kindī would supervise a diverse team of scholars from around the empire as they worked to
translate and expand on the texts they received and stored. While others specialized
in translating works about medicine or mathematics, al-Kindī’s team of mostly
Christian translators worked to introduce Greek philosophy to the Islamic world. His influence and power were profound, with him even spending some time as a
tutor for the son of Al-Ma’mūn’s brother and successor, al-Mu’taṣim. Outside of
philosophy, he also invented the field of cryptography and wrote on topics ranging
from pharmacology to astronomy. However, by the time that al-Mutawakkil became caliph, al-Kindī began to lose favor in the royal courts; at one point losing control of
the House of Wisdom. He is said to have died as a lonely old man in a Baghdad that
had left him behind. Despite not seeing the significance of his influence within his
own life, it is difficult to overstate his eventual importance in the history of philosophy.
 
In order to understand al-Kindī’s philosophical contributions, it may be
helpful to know some of the intellectual background to the period in which he
 
212 worked. As we have already mentioned, the falsafa tradition is predated in the region
by the tradition of kalām, which has its own debates on the nature of God,
knowledge, and reality. One particularly controversial group within the kalām
tradition is the Mu’tazila school. This group was founded by a figure named Wāṣil 
ibn ʿAtāʾ and was associated with a number of Islamic doctrines which were seen as potentially heretical to many of their contemporaries. Here, the school’s views about
three topics have come to define them: 1) divine attributes, 2) the creation of the
Qur’an, and 3) the problem of free-will. With regards to the question of divine
attributes, the Mu’tazila school endorses a negative theology. This is to say that the only way to approach the nature of God is by saying what is not true of him. The
easiest way to understand this idea might be to return to the Neoplatonist Plotinus.
Plotinus had posited a supreme One that was so unified as to be beyond description.
To say that the one was one way would mean excluding the opposite way it could be. The Mu’tazila school adopts a similar stance with regards to God. According to
them, God is so singular and unified that any description of him will be too limiting
to be accurate.48 In the case of the creation of the Qur’an, one popular debate within
kalām at the time was over the question of whether God predates the Qur’an. While the dominant teachings at the time suggested that the Qur’an was eternal, The
Mu’tazilites argued that because God created the Qur’an, he must have existed prior
to it. Finally, the Mu’tazila school also argued for the existence of free-will in order to
answer the problem of evil. Remember that this problem is one of reconciling the goodness and justness of God with the existence of evil in the world. The Mu’tazila
school preserves the justice of God by arguing that evil exists in the world as a result
of human action which is freely chosen. These doctrines matter for understanding
the work of al-Kindī because, despite its unorthodox nature, al-Ma’mūm established the Mu’tazila doctrine as the official position of the Abbasid caliphate. This put al-
Kindī, as an agent of the state, in the position of defending it. This not to say that he
didn’t endorse the doctrine on his own, but that he was likely selected for the job
 
48 This can be thought of as a particularly strong form of the ‘doctrine of divine simplicity’. This is the view that God does not permit of being divided into parts (in space, time, or in terms of properties). Various versions of this doctrine are also very popular within Christian theology (though not universally accepted). For instance, the view was also endorsed by the medieval Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas. More can be read about Aquinas and his philosophical views in the “Medieval & Renaissance Philosophy” chapter.  
 
213 because of his endorsement of it. Finally, al-Kindī represents a good choice to the
Mu’tazilite caliph because the school also recognizes the legitimacy of reason. While
some schools of kalām argue that the only way to the truth is through the revelations
of the prophet Muhammad, the Mu’tazilites see reason as another method to obtain the truth, even if most people won’t engage with it. Since both reason and revelation
point at the same truths, reason is as legitimate as religious dedication. This idea sets
the stage for al-Kindī to kickstart the falsafa tradition.
 
If al-Kindī’s project is to reconcile Islamic doctrine with Greek philosophy,
and the Mu’tazila school is his dominant influence from the side of kalām, then Aristotle is his largest Greek influence. Aristotle scholarship dominated the early
efforts of the Arabic translation movement. However, Aristotelianism in the Islamic
world does not merely amount to a rehashing of what Aristotle had already argued.
This is, in part, because of an error. Mixed in among the Aristotelian manuscripts at
the House of Wisdom were some texts from Neoplatonists like Plotinus and Proclus (who argued that the Greek gods act causally within particular domains on behalf of
Plotinus’ One).49 These works were accidentally attributed to Aristotle, and the
philosophers of the Islamic Golden Age set to work interpreting Neoplatonism and Aristotelianism as a single unified system. This version of Aristotle is what al-Kindī
will draw on in his own philosophizing, and the resulting synthesis of Aristotle,
Neoplatonism, and Mu’tazilite Islam provides the original basis for further
philosophy in the region.
 
This very particular synthesis is demonstrated in al-Kindī’s account of God. As we have already seen, the Mu’tazilite doctrine was that God is a pure unity that
existed beyond description. It’s easy to see how Plotinus’ One could come to be
identified with this conception of God, as the One is the source of all unity. Al-Kindī
combines this with Aristotle’s idea of God as pure form. Aristotle had given us God as the uncaused cause of the universe, and by calling this pure form, Plotinus and
Aristotle can be brought together to explain how the first cause of the world is also a
total unity. This combined doctrine posits that God is the ‘true One’ (‘al-wāḥid bi-al-
ḥaqīqa’). Accordingly, we can call this view about the nature of God the doctrine of 
 
49 Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, a likely student Proclus, would later use his framework to argue that the One must be the Christian God. 
 
214 the true One. This story, in turn, informs al-Kindī’s account of first philosophy. Aristotle had argued that metaphysics was the most fundamental inquiry, and one
which grounds all other phenomena and investigations. In place of metaphysics, al-
Kindī argues that theology is first philosophy. God is the creator of all things, so understanding the causes and nature of things fully requires knowing the nature of
God. This demonstrates the compatibility of philosophy with Islam, because it
subordinates further philosophical inquiry to God.
 
With this account in hand, al-Kindī has found a way of using Aristotle (and
Neoplatonism) to affirm the Mu’tazilite doctrine of the utter oneness of God. This is helpful in defending the Mu’tazilite school from their rivals, but it would also be
helpful in defending Islam in public debates against Christians. Public debates like
this were common in Baghdad and, by employing Neoplatonism to defend God as a
unity, scholars would now be able to argue against Christian trinitarianism (or the philosophical position that God exists as three persons in one being). However, al-
Kindī has also set up a theory of causation which he can use to address two other big
problems from the kalām tradition: the creation of the Qur’an and the creation of
the universe. Aristotle had argued that the universe was eternal and so will the Mu’tazila school’s main rival within kalām, the Ashʿarī school. Indeed, most Greek
thinkers followed Aristotle in this belief, including the Neoplatonists. However, al-
Kindī was able to draw on the work of the Egyptian Christian theologian John 
Philoponus in order to justify the Mu’tazilite position. Philoponus was an outspoken critic of Aristotle and, as a Christian, sought to affirm God’s creation of
the world against Aristotle’s theory of a permanent universe. Al-Kindī’s refutation of
Aristotle follows Philoponus’ in attempting to use Aristotelianism against itself.
Elsewhere, Aristotle had argued that actual infinities couldn’t exist. While math can
describe them, there can be nothing that is, for instance, infinitely large. However, al-Kindī points out that if the universe can’t be infinite in size because actual infinities
can’t exist, this also means that the universe can’t be infinite in time. Thus, he
concludes, the universe must have some beginning. This argument serves the dual
function of addressing the question of the creation of the Qur’an as well. God stands alone at the beginning of time, as the first cause of all things, and the Qur’an (like the
universe) is temporally limited.
 
215
The final topic worth mentioning about Al-Kindī is his account of music,
and like his work in metaphysics, his philosophy of music draws on a wide array of
global influences. One example of this is his use of Greek writings on medicine. The
physician and medical writer Hippocrates (after whom the Hippocratic oath takes its name) is credited with first applying the ancient theory of humors to the treatment
of patients. According to this theory, there are four humors (or bodily fluids) that
must be in balance within a person. Health and behavioral problems arise from an
imbalance of the humors. For instance, too much phlegm would make a person
lethargic. Al-Kindī argued that the four strings of the oud (a Persian lute) corresponded to these humors. On the basis of this, we can explain the effect that
music has on people’s moods. Likewise, al-Kindī writes that physicians could heal
the body by playing harmonious music, which could bring about a similar harmony
with a person’s humors. In fact, the four strings of the oud reflect the abundance of fourfold distinctions in the world (e.g., the four seasons, and the four elements). By
contrast, instruments from other cultures were thought to represent the dominant
metaphysics of those societies. As further evidence of this, al-Kindī points towards
the similarity between a single-stringed Indian instrument called the ‘ektara’ and the metaphysics common to much of Hinduism. In this case, non-dualist schools like
advaita vedanta are said to be forms of monism, because they argue that reality is
ultimately composed of one thing (i.e., Brahman), and this is reflected in the single
string of the ektara.
 
Al-Fārābī
 
While al-Kindī did not retain his power and influence during his own life,
the House of Wisdom continued to produce scholars of acclaim. It was within this
context that we see the emergence of a group of thinkers which have come to be
known as the ‘Baghdad school’. These were a mixture of Muslim and Christian philosophers who were united in their adherence to Aristotelianism. Chief among
these Baghdad school philosophers is al-Fārābī (born Abû Nasr al-Fârâbî). Al-Fārābī’s contributions to philosophy were so large that he came to be known by
 
216 philosophers in the region as ‘the second teacher’ (with the first being Aristotle). His
philosophical work covers a wide range of topics, including following Ptolemais of
Cyrene in arguing that both mathematics and the human ear play a role in judging
music. Yet, despite his importance within the history of philosophy, much less is known about his life than is known of al-Kindī. While we know that the name al-
Fārābī references the place of his birth, it isn’t exactly clear whether this was Faryāb
in modern day Afghanistan or Fārāb in modern day Kazakhstan. Other than this, we
can say that he was likely of Persian descent, and that he spent a considerable amount
of time in Baghdad before extended stays in Aleppo, Egypt, and Damascus.
 
While al-Kindī had drawn substantially on the work of Aristotle (and the
Neoplatonists), he had still departed from his thought in some radical ways. For
instance, al-Kindī argued that theology, rather than metaphysics, was first
philosophy. In keeping with the Aristotelian commitments of the Baghdad school, al-Fārābī returns metaphysics to what he sees as its rightful place as first philosophy.
His philosophical program proceeds; accordingly, by focusing his efforts on
metaphysics. As our discussion of al-Kindī suggests, one of the most popular
metaphysical questions in Islamic Golden Age falsafa and kalām was the problem of causation. Here, as we might expect, al-Fārābī frames his theory of causation in the
context of an argument made by Aristotle. This argument, called the sea-battle argument, asks us to consider a statement about the future (such as ‘there will be a
sea-battle tomorrow). This statement is either true or false; there either will or won’t be a sea-battle tomorrow. However, the truth or falsity of a sentence depends on the
matter being settled; the statement is, for instance, true because it lines up with the
facts of the matter about the way things will be. This means that whether or not the
statement is true or false, because it is one of the two today, the fact of the matter
about the way things are tomorrow is already settled. As we already know, the idea that there is only one way the future can be is called determinism. However, when
we encountered determinism before, it was in the context of causal determinism
(that is, that determinism is true because of facts about causation). Here, Aristotle is
arguing for logical determinism. This is the position that we can know that determinism is true because of facts about logic. Here’s Aristotle’s argument put
more simply:
 
217
1.   It is necessarily true that ‘the future will be one way or another’.
 
2.   If a statement is necessarily true, then there is necessarily a fact of
the matter about the content of that statement.
 
3.   Therefore, there is necessarily a fact of the matter about the way the
future will be.
 
4.   If there is necessarily a fact of the matter today about the way things
will be in the future, then the future is determined.
 
5.   Therefore, the future is determined.
 
While al-Fārābī is an Aristotelian, he is also a Mu’tazilite, and that means affirming that humans have free-will. Further, unlike the Epicurean compatibilists
we have already discussed, al-Fārābī sees the future being completely fixed as a
problem for free-will. The philosophical position that these two concepts are
incompatible can, predictably, be called incompatibilism. Given this intuition, this
puts al-Fārābī in the position of having to reconcile Aristotle with his interpretation of Islam. The first thing that al-Fārābī points out is that this argument doesn’t appear
in Aristotle’s works on physics or metaphysics, but in his works on logic. He takes
this as evidence that Aristotle’s argument isn’t a metaphysical one at all, but one
about the workings of logic. al-Fārābī then interprets Aristotle’s argument backwards. The basic reading of Aristotle’s argument tells us that he thinks that the
future must be determined because statements about the future are necessarily either
true or false. On al-Fārābī’s interpretation, Aristotle sees this conclusion as absurd,
and this leads him to conclude that statements about the future can’t be necessarily true or false. This, by contrast, is a conclusion about logic, where the other is a
conclusion about metaphysics. First, here is the basic interpretation:
 
1.   Facts about the future are necessarily true or false.
2.   If facts about the future are necessarily true or false, then
determinism is true.
3.   Therefore, determinism is true.
 
Now, here is al-Fārābī’s interpretation:
 
218
1.   If facts about the future are necessarily true or false, then
determinism is true.
2.   Determinism is false.
3.   Therefore, facts about the future are not necessarily true or false.
 
With the problem of defending free-will out of the way, al-Fārābī can now speak more fully about causation. In particular, how God serves as the first cause of
the universe. In this case, al-Fārābī builds off of the doctrine of the true One. Al-
Kindī had already contended that God is pure form, and al-Fārābī uses this account
to explain the act of creation. God caused the world to come into being by imparting some of his pure unity into it. The act of creation is the act of unification. God
makes the stars by bringing them together and making them a singular thing (i.e., a
star). These celestial bodies then radiate unity down to smaller bodies until the unity
is transmitted to us.  al-Fārābī calls this process ‘emanation’, and we can call this
theory al-Fārābī’s theory of emanation. Thus, while we might think that our parents caused us to come into being, al-Fārābī argues that God intervenes (through
these emanations) at the proper moment to create each of us. Our parents may
prepare matter to receive the form (the material cause), but God steps in afterwards to make us each a unified person. Thus, even if our parents may be the closest
efficient cause of us, God is the ultimate efficient cause because creation is an act of
unification, and God is the ultimate source of unity.
 
Al-Fārābī also defends another Mu’tazilite doctrine: rational theology.
Here, rational theology is just the name for the idea, which we have already seen, that reason is a legitimate path to the truth that religion reveals through revelation. Al-
Fārābī attempts to provide an account of the relationship between revelation and
falsafa and use this distinction to inform his political philosophy. For him, there is
one single truth about the way that the world is because the truth is revealed to us, ultimately, by one God: Allah. However, that truth can be accessed in different ways.
Here, al-Fārābī draws on a distinction, predictably, from Aristotle. He had
distinguished between the mind’s rational capacity and its imaginative capacity. Al-
Fārābī argues that philosophers access this truth through their rational capacity, but prophets access it through their imaginative capacity. Accordingly, the same
knowledge (in this case, the truth of Islam) is revealed to the prophet through images
which they must interpret as is revealed to the philosopher through arguments that
 
219 they must think through. This difference will be key in al-Fārābī’s account of the
ideal state.
 
Like many of the Aristotelians in the Islamic world, al-Fārābī’s
understanding of Aristotle is also heavily influenced by Neoplatonism. Here, al-
Fārābī follows Plato in thinking that individual people need an ideal government in
order to truly be happy.50 Likewise, he also agrees with Plato that the ideal form of
government would be one led by philosopher kings. However, rather than merely
being well-ordered and pointed at wisdom, al-Fārābī argues that the ideal state would
be full of people who commit the right actions because they have the right beliefs. It makes sense, then, that philosophers should be in charge, because they are capable of
accessing the totality of truths in the world through their intellectual capacities.
However, applying this information to specific problems and anticipating the future
needs of the people requires a robust imaginative capacity as well. Accordingly, the perfect ruler will be one who is both a philosopher and a prophet. Accordingly, al-
Fārābī’s account can be said to endorse a form of theocracy, or rule by religious
authority. While al-Fārābī’s theory is committed to the idea that this person would
not know any more than could be known by a philosopher, they do have at least one more advantage over the philosophers. Beyond the benefits of their imaginative
capacities, the prophet-king resolves an issue that plagued Plato; how to convince the
people to move towards wisdom. Plato recognized that most people would not want
to be ruled by philosophers and thought that it would require a noble lie to convince them. However, the prophet would be capable of bringing regular people to wisdom
because they can draw on the prophetic images which were emanated to them by
God. These more digestible stories will allow the prophet to direct their subjects
towards wisdom in a way that philosophical arguments could not. This also has the
benefit of presumably being true, where the noble lie is quite explicitly not.
 
50 Al-Fārābī is not the only Islamic Golden Age philosopher to develop a neo-Platonic political philosophy. Ibn Bâjja (sometimes Anglicized as Avempace) did the same. However, Bâjja’s account inverts Plato’s analysis, arguing that the individual should be modelled on the just state and not the other way around. Bâjja was also a well-regarded commentator on Aristotle and a defender of al-Fārābī.
 
220
Ibn Sīnā
 
While al-Kindī and al-Fārābī each had a considerable impact on philosophy
during the Islamic Golden Age, the figure who looms the largest during this period is
Ibn Sīnā (born Abū ʿAlī al-Ḥusayn bin ʿAbdullāh ibn al-Ḥasan bin ʿAlī bin Sīnā al-
Balkhi al-Bukhari and sometimes referred to by the latinized Avicenna). He was born
in the village of Afshana in modern day Uzbekistan, and he was apparently something of a child prodigy. He memorized the Qur’an by the age of ten and
became a self-taught physician by seventeen. He then spent a period of time living
and working under the patronage of various rulers; being forced to leave one place
for another as these rulers were overthrown. However, it was while in Hamadan in western Iran that Ibn Sīnā began to make a name for himself as a philosopher. It was
customary for newly arrived philosophers to engage in a public debate with local
scholars so that they could find their place within the intellectual hierarchy of that
community. In this case, Ibn Sīnā debated a local adherent of the Baghdad school and things apparently got heated. The debate ended with Ibn Sīnā accusing his rival
of lacking basic knowledge in logic and being, himself, accused of impoliteness. The
two continued the feud after the public debate; with Ibn Sīnā contacting the
Baghdad school in disbelief that his rival accurately represented the views of the school, and with his rival spreading rumors about Ibn Sīnā which ultimately resulted
in the police getting involved.  Ibn Sīnā’s temperament in these debates became a
recurring theme. In another, he and a grammarian debated over whether it was better
to study Arabic grammar or Aristotelian logic. However, Ibn Sīnā prepared for this by recording and compiling every obscure fact about Arabic grammar that he could
and binding them together in a book. Then, during the debate, Ibn Sīnā asked the
grammarian to explain all of the facts he had assembled on the spot in front of the
crowd.
 
The above stories demonstrate Ibn Sīnā’s philosophical confidence. We see the same confidence in his apparent reputation for drinking alcohol despite its being
prohibited in Islam. One story has him being confronted for this and claiming that
the negative effects of alcohol didn’t apply to him because he was able to guard his
mind with philosophy. However, he wasn’t merely a philosopher; he wrote prolifically on a wide range of topics, from philosophy to geology and from
 
221 psychology to mathematics. Outside of this, his five-volume medical text The Canon 
of Medicine became the standard medical textbook throughout the Middle East and
Europe for the next seven hundred years.
 
In terms of his philosophical work, what makes Ibn Sīnā stand out from his
predecessors is his willingness to depart from Aristotle. This is not entirely new, as al-Kindī was willing to argue that theology is first philosophy, and al-Fārābī was more
than happy to, at least, interpret Aristotle’s sea-battle argument in a nontraditional
way. Nevertheless, these differences pale in comparison to the work of Ibn Sīnā, who
attempts to establish his own school, even if it means abandoning Aristotelianism. Indeed, he even names his own school the ‘Eastern school’ to contrast himself with
the work done in Baghdad. He does this by criticizing Aristotle and by leaning more
heavily into Neoplatonism. Despite his turn towards Neoplatonism, however, Ibn
Sīnā makes many contributions of his own to philosophy, particularly with regards to logic and metaphysics.
 
As we mentioned in our discussion of Aristotle, Aristotelian logic is, and
was at the time, dominated by the framework of the square of opposition. According
to it, if a universal statement is true, then the corresponding particular statement is also true, but not vice versa. For example, if it is true that ‘no cats are St. Bernards’,
then we can also conclude, at least, that ‘some cats aren’t St. Bernards’. However, the
problem with the square of opposition arises in claims about fictional things. Take,
for instance, unicorns. Consider the claim that ‘no unicorns have two horns’. Is this
claim true or false? Most people would want to answer that it is true because what it means to be a unicorn is to be a horse with exactly one horn. After all, having one
horn is right there in the name. However, if this statement is true, then the square of
opposition tells us that it is at least true that ‘some unicorns don’t have two horns’.
Unfortunately, we have now said that it is true that there are some unicorns (namely, one with one horn). This can’t be right. Aristotle’s logical system has committed us
to the view that unicorns exist. Given that we can derive existential claims (about
what exists) from universal statements, Aristotle’s square of opposition is said to
have ‘existential import’. For this reason, modern logicians no longer include subalternation on the square of opposition.
 
222
However, Ibn Sīnā is sensitive in some ways to the problems of existential
import. Here, he draws a distinction between existence and essence. We can say that
unicorns have the property of having one horn essentially, in that in order to be a
unicorn, a thing must have one and only one horn. However, the question of the unicorn's essence is different from the question of its existence. All we have really
committed to is saying that ‘if a unicorn exists, then it must have one horn’, not that
they do. With this distinction in hand, Ibn Sīnā is led to wonder about the
relationship between existence and essence. For instance, could there be a being that
has the property of existing in its essence? That is, is it possible that there is a being which must necessarily exist? Ibn Sīnā thinks there must be, and he identifies this
being with God.
 
Where the Baghdad school thought of God as the true One, Ibn Sīnā claims
that God is the necessary existent (a term later philosophers will take up). However, Ibn Sīnā does not just think that this is so, he argues it. In this case, he asks us to
consider all of the events and things that have happened, are happening, or will
happen. We can ask whether these things must have existed or not. Could there have
been nothing instead of something? We probably think so; that is, that all of existence is contingent. There very well could have been nothing instead of
something. However, if this is true, then the existence of things is contingent on
something. Something had to have made the difference between there being the
world we know and there being nothing at all in existence. This means there must be an ultimate cause of existence. In this case, we could ask the same question about this
cause; does it exist necessarily or contingently. Here, we are told that it can’t exist
contingently because, if it did, it would have been included in our list of all
contingent things. Therefore, it must exist necessarily. With that, Ibn Sīnā takes
himself to have proven the existence of God. This would become one of the most significant arguments in Medieval philosophy, and it has come to be known as the
Proof of the Truthful. With it, Ibn Sīnā has overturned the Aristotelian tradition
of arguing for the existence of God by appealing to the natural world and, instead,
initiated a tradition of arguing for the existence of God on the basis of metaphysics itself (or the kind of being that God is). The argument is summarized below:
 
223
1.   The universe is contingent.
2.   What is contingent must have a cause.
3.   Therefore, the universe must have a cause.
4.   The cause of the universe must either be necessary or contingent.
5.   The cause of the universe can't be contingent.
6.   Therefore, the cause of the universe is necessary.
 
Beyond this, Ibn Sīnā is notable for arguing for dualism as a solution to the
mind-body problem. As a reminder, dualism tells us that the mind and body are two
distinct things, and depending on the type of dualism one defends, this could open up the possibility of an afterlife.  Ibn Sīnā’s argument involves a thought experiment
called the floating man. Here, Ibn Sīnā asks us to imagine a person who is created
by God instantly and in midair. This person is suspended so that they can’t make
contact with the ground or even with other parts of their body. Further, they are created without the ability to see or hear. The result of this is that the floating man is
cut off from all sense experience. Yet, Ibn Sīnā argues, if we were this floating man,
we could still be aware of ourselves. This is because our self-awareness is not
reducible to the sensations of the body. Accordingly, there is something beyond our
body which constitutes our essence; that is, a soul.51
 
Al-Ghazali 
 
Outside of falsafa and kalām, another tradition has been building in the
background of the Islamic world; sufism. Sufism is less a philosophical position than it is, like asceticism, a philosophical and religious practice. However, Sufism is both
larger and more particular than asceticism. In this case, it refers to an Islamic
 
51 Ibn Sīnā’s floating man anticipates, in many ways, the work of the later French philosopher Rene Descartes. More can be read about Descartes’ own argument for mind-body dualism in the “Rene Descartes'' chapter.

tradition of meditation and asceticism which aims at becoming one with God.52 We
are told that the first person to be called a Sufi was Abū Hāshim (born ʿAbd Allāh ibn Muḥammad ibn al-Ḥanafīyya). Hāshim lived about one hundred years prior to
al-Kindī and, as such, his ideas were likely not influenced by Greek philosophy. However, later Sufis would be able to find a deep compatibility between the Sufi
ideal of becoming one with God through meditation and some later ideas from
Neoplatonism.
 
Al-Fārābī had expanded on Plotinus’ account of the One. On Plotinus’
model, the One is pure unity which serves as the source of unity in other things. Al-Fārābī built on this with his theory of emanations, in which unity is passed down
through a series of celestial entities. While the details of this story are unique to Al-
Fārābī, as was the identification of these celestial entities with the angels which
appear within Islam, earlier Neoplatonists had told a similar story. For instance, Proclus had argued that the Greek gods served as middlemen between our world and
the One. However, just as unity can move down this causal chain in the form of
emanations, the Neoplatonists also thought we could turn back towards the pure
unity. By reflecting on the One (a process known as reversion), we can receive form and order from it. Not only is this a possibility for us, we are called to do it as the
highest ideal. In engaging in reversion, we turn away from the material world (the
earthly desires of Plato’s poorly trained horse) and toward the One (Plato’s form of
the good). If Sufism calls us to reflect and, in doing so, attempt to become unified with God, then it is not far removed from the ideal of reversion.
 
Another core idea which is taken up by later Sufis is the doctrine of divine love (‘Ishq-e Haqīqi’). While earlier Sufis had sought to achieve unity with God
through their ascetic and meditative practices, Rābi’a of Basra (born Rābi’a al-
ʿAdawiyya al-Qaysiyya) is credited with introducing divine love as central to this practice. According to her, God is the only being deserving of being loved and
capable of loving us back. This orients later meditative practice towards love as the
 
52 The medieval Christian mystic philosopher, Meister Eckhart, would advocate for a similar aim for humans (in being one with god). Indeed, for Eckhart, if we were to truly achieve this unity in our minds and live in light of it, we would cease to refer to God as a separate and distinct being, and speak only of ‘Godhead’, as the causal component of this unity. 
 
225 vehicle for unity with God. We can, and Rābi’a does, contrast this with the religious
life offered to us by rational theology. Rābi’a sees many of those around her as
convinced of the truth of Islam but not oriented into a loving relationship with God.
However, it is love and not reason that allows for unity with the divine. This model, in which we should aim to love God as a pure unity, is strikingly similar to Diotima’s
ladder of love, which calls us to love the form of Beauty itself. However, Rābi’a of
Basra is not entirely removed from the use of reason in religious life; at one point
providing an argument against some extreme ascetic practices. As we have already
seen, some ascetics will argue that earthly desire, physical existence, or reality itself are illusory and, thus, must be rejected. These people are called renunciates because they
renounce the material world as devoid of goodness and turn toward some better
plane of reality. Rābi’a’s argument, like that of Indian Yoga school philosopher
Patañjali, is that we should adopt a kind of detachment from the world rather than reject it. This is because the critical stance towards the world is actually self-defeating.
Her argument for this claim is as follows:
 
1.   Renunciates criticize the world.
2.   We only criticize what we think has value
(as we simply ignore things of no value).
3.   Therefore, the renunciate thinks that the world has value.
 
Because Rābi’a of Basra didn’t write down her ideas or her reasoning for
them, this argument is, instead, preserved in a text called The Revival of the Religious 
Sciences by al-Ghazali (born Abū Ḥāmid Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad aṭ-Ṭūsiyy al-Ġazzālīy). Beyond recording her arguments in what has come to be regarded as his
magnum opus, al-Ghazali also takes up Rābi’a’s skepticism about the power of mere
reason and develops it into a systematic critique of both the Baghdad and Eastern
schools.
 
Al-Ghazali was born in Tus in northeastern Iran. Though we don’t know
for sure, on some accounts al-Ghazali was orphaned at a young age. According to
this story, he and his brother were then left in the care of a Sufi. He then spent most
of his young life studying under various scholars before becoming an accomplished teacher himself. However, at the height of his professional career, al-Ghazali had
something of an existential crisis, worrying about the significance and truth of his
 
226 work. He renounced his job and disposed of his finances so that he could adopt the
lifestyle of a traveling ascetic in pursuit of spiritual experience. As you might expect,
this meant that al-Ghazali turned further toward religion and the methodology of
Sufism. For the rest of his life, he resisted (as best as he could) attempts to lure him back into a full-time teaching position at state-sponsored schools and opted instead
to guide others through their spiritual practices in Sufi lodges and private academies.
However, he did record his criticisms of the Baghdad school and of Ibn Sīnā in a
book titled The Incoherence of the Philosophers.
 
Al-Ghazali’s criticisms of these schools focus on (for our purposes) two domains: the power of reason and the problem of causation. First, consider the
reason that al-Ghazali recounts for his crisis of faith in the first place. We have seen
throughout our investigations that sense perception and reason are often in conflict.
For instance, as Aristotle points out, despite appearing small, we know from reason that the Sun is actually quite large. This shows us that reason has the power to
overturn what is given to us by perception. Reason is, it seems, a higher court than
the court of the senses. However, al-Ghazali asks whether we have any basis for
thinking that reason itself is the supreme court of the mind. That is, could some other capacity overturn what is obvious to reason in the same way that reason
overturns what is obvious to the senses? Of course, we couldn’t know this through
reason, or else the very conclusion that there is could, itself, be overturned in this
higher court of appeals. This seems to show that reason can’t settle all matters. However, al-Ghazali’s aims are more ambitious. While he has given us some reason
for thinking that reason could be incomplete, and thus rejected al-Fārābī’s
Mu’tazilite claim that reason and imagination are both complete paths to the same
truth, he also wants to defend his Sufi practices. This means that he must show that
spiritual practice is capable of revealing what reason cannot not.
 
Here, al-Ghazali tells us that true knowledge is not earned through
reasoning but gifted from God. This model is keeping with the doctrine of divine
love, as al-Ghazali describes his own experience of this gift as a beam of light entering
his heart (rather than entering his head through argumentation). However, it is not so much that this replaces the role of reason but that it supplements and guarantees
the results of reason. Rābi’a’s laments weren’t that the Muslims around her were too
reasonable, but that they reasoned and didn’t love. For al-Ghazali, divine love
 
227 provided direct assurances that what is revealed in one’s exercise of reason won’t be
overturned in a, as of yet undetermined, higher court. We might be tempted to
wonder why al-Ghazali couldn’t just tell philosophers the truth that was revealed to
them so that they could have their reason guaranteed as well. To this, al-Ghazali explains that it would be equivalent to a blind person asking for a sighted person to
explain colors to them.
 
We have already seen the influence that al-Ghazali’s Sufism plays on his
treatment of reason, but he also has another influence which plays a similar role in
his account of causation: the Ashʿarī school. As mentioned above, al-Ghazali studied under a number of different teachers. One of his most significant and influential
instructors was the Ashʿarī school jurist al-Juwayni. While there is some debate about
whether al-Ghazali was an Ashʿarīte in full or merely accepted some of their
doctrines, he was likely influenced by al-Juwayni to accept their theory of causation.
In this case, the Ashʿarī school’s founder, Abū al-Ḥasan al-Ashʿarī, was famous for defending occasionalism as the answer to the problem of causation.
Occasionalism is the philosophical position that God is the efficient cause of all
events. This means that God intervenes in the physical world to serve as a mediator between physical objects and their apparent effects, and that he does so in every
instance.53 You may think that you caused the window to break by throwing a rock
through it but, according to occasionalism, it was actually God who stepped in at the
moment of impact in order to cause it to break.
 
Al-Ghazali argues for his occasionalism with an example about burning cotton. According to al-Ghazali, philosophers so far have assumed that things which
are, themselves, caused, serve as the efficient cause of other events. For instance, our
parents are the efficient cause of us in spite of having been caused by their parents.
However, we might wonder what it actually means for one thing to be the efficient cause of another thing. One tempting answer (taken up by Ibn Sīnā) is to say that
causation is a matter of two things having a necessary relationship. By this light, to
say that lighting cotton on fire causes it to burn is to say that when we do this, it will
 
53 Occasionalism was also famously defended by the early modern philosopher Nicolas Malebranche. More can be read about his defense of the position in the “The Rationalists” chapter.  
 
228 necessarily burn. However, al-Ghazali points out that this isn’t exactly true. Of
course, we expect it to burn because it has in the past, but there is nothing to say that
this must be the case.54 As evidence of this, al-Ghazali says that God could, in any
given instance, step in to prevent the fire from burning the cotton. However, if this is true, then we are no closer to saying what it means to cause something. Al-Ghazali
addresses this by inverting the problem. While this example showed us a problem
with necessity as an account of causation, it also showed us that we do know
something about causation; namely, that God has power over it. Accordingly,
instead of thinking that God could intervene in an otherwise necessary relationship, why not think that God is responsible for the otherwise exceptionless relationship in
the first place. This answer (that is, occasionalism) provides us with an account of
why things are caused, but it also explains the reality of miracles. Instead of being
violations of the causal laws of nature, they are just specific instances of it. God acts constantly so as to keep things the way they are, so God acting differently to (for
instance) prevent someone from burning in a fire rather than to be burned by it, is
just more of the same; God acting.
 
Ibn Rushd 
 
With Ibn Rushd (born Abū l-Walīd Muḥammad Ibn ʾAḥmad Ibn Rušd and often latinized as Averroes), we move the spotlight of our story back to Europe.
As we mentioned at the start of this chapter, the Islamic world covered a massive
amount of territory during this time period. Included among this territory is what was then al-Andalus and is now modern-day Spain. Ibn Rushd is the first, but not
the last, philosopher we will mention from al-Andalus. He was born to a prominent
family of jurists and public servants in Córdoba and is said to have received the
education we might expect for a young man of his standing. Upon completing his studies, he traveled to Marrakesh in Morocco in order to help in establishing colleges
and to engage in astronomical observations. While there, he met the philosopher Ibn 
 
54 This point is very similar to that made by the later philosopher David Hume. More can be read about his theory of causation in the “The Sentimentalists” chapter. 
 
229
Ṭufayl (born Abū Bakr Muḥammad bin ʿAbd al-Malik bin Muḥammad bin Ṭufayl al-Qaysiyy al-ʾAndalusiyy), a fellow Andalusian. Around the time of this encounter,
Ibn Ṭufayl was establishing himself on the basis of a philosophical novel which has
come to be known by the latinized name of Philosophus Autodidactus.55 This notoriety presented Ibn Ṭufayl with the opportunity to introduce Ibn Rushd to the
leader of the Almohad caliphate, which controlled northwestern Africa and al-
Andalus at the time. We are told that the caliph, Abu Ya`qub Yusuf, complained to
Ibn Ṭufayl about the difficulty of understanding Aristotle, and Ibn Ṭufayl
encouraged him to support Ibn Rushd in writing commentaries on Aristotle’s work. This patronage would come to define Ibn Rushd’s philosophical legacy. Despite
possibly being the first person to identify the retina as the light-sensing part of the
eye and the first to describe the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, Ibn Rushd’s
reputation is one of being the greatest historical commentator on Aristotle. Indeed, when Greek philosophical texts and their Arabic commentaries were later
rediscovered by European Christians during the reconquest of Spain, Aristotle
became known among them as ‘the philosopher’ and Ibn Rushd became known as
‘the commentator’. However, this work came to an end after the death of Abu Ya`qub Yusuf. Ibn Rushd found himself cut off from power, and his enemies
formed various tribunals, launched numerous investigations focused on him, and
ordered his works banned and destroyed. While he survived this ordeal, returning
briefly to the royal court, he died shortly after, and his body was returned to al-Andalus.
 
As we have already mentioned, Ibn Rushd’s philosophical legacy is
primarily that of a commentator on Aristotle. This is for two reasons. First, working
in al-Andalus cut him off from the bulk of Arabic language philosophers and Arabic
language philosophy. As its name would suggest, Ibn Sīnā’s Eastern school became dominant in the east, and Ibn Rushd’s work made few inroads on account of the
 
55 The novel would later be translated into Latin by the English scholar Edward Pococke, and his student, the philosopher John Locke, would be influenced by it in the development of his epistemic theory. More can be read about Locke’s theory of knowledge and Ibn Ṭufayl’s influence on it in the “The Empiricists” chapter. It would also have an influence on the Italian Renaissance philosopher Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, a Neoplatonist who promoted Christian kabbalah, or the practice of analyzing the language used in the Bible to uncover hidden wisdom.  
 
230 difficulty and expense of transporting written works across north Africa. Second, the
reconquest of Spain brought Greek philosophy more fully back into European
Christian life. These thinkers were less concerned with the aspects of Ibn Rushd’s
work which deal with debates in Islamic theology than they were with his work on Aristotle. These two trends, combined, meant that there was only sizable demand for
Ibn Rushd’s commentaries. Nevertheless, he did contribute a few ideas of his own.
Namely, concerning the relationship between religion and philosophy and on the
intellect.
 
While his being remembered for Aristotle scholarship is, in some sense, a historical accident, his willingness to write on Aristotle’s view was not. Ibn Rushd
was an Aristotelian in the strongest sense. He rejected, at the same time, Ibn Sīnā’s
Neoplatonic influence and al-Ghazali’s criticisms of the Baghdad school. While he
was born too late (and in the wrong part of the world) to be a member of the Baghdad school, he was in many ways a defender of al-Fārābī’s philosophical project.
Where he departs from it, it is typically insofar as it draws on Neoplatonic ideas.
While the Baghdad school erroneously attributed some works of later Neoplatonists
to Aristotle (and worked to reconcile the two), this error had been realized by Ibn Rushd’s time, and he sought to correct the matter.
 
Despite these differences, Ibn Rushd seems to be fully in sync with al-Fārābī
when it comes to the relationship between philosophy and religion. Al-Fārābī had
argued that the two were merely different methods for getting at the same truth;
philosophy revealed truth through reason and revelation revealed truth through the imaginative capacity. Meanwhile, Ibn Rushd draws on his upbringing in a family of
prominent jurists to make a further claim: Islam actually commands those who can
to study philosophy. According to Ibn Rushd, the Qur’an commands believers to
‘consider the creation of the earth’ and doing this well just means doing philosophy. However, Ibn Rushd also goes further than al-Fārābī in another way. Where al-
Fārābī had distinguished between the rational and imaginative capacities to
distinguish the difference between philosophy and religion, Ibn Rushd introduces a
three-part scheme. Here, he tells us that philosophers uncover truth through the demonstrative method, theologians discover it through the dialectical method, and
believers uncover it through the rhetorical method. In this case, these methods are
distinguished according to the background beliefs of their audiences. The
 
231 demonstrative method draws on what is necessarily true. This gives philosophical
insight a force that we don’t find elsewhere, but it also depends on its audience being
able to recognize what is necessarily true already. By contrast, the premises of the
dialectical method are generally accepted as true but may not necessarily be so. Finally, regular folks must content themselves with the rhetorical method, which
plays a particular role in reinforcing what is revealed in these other methods.
According to Ibn Rushd, this makes rhetorical documents like the Qur’an especially
fit for public consumption; because it is persuasive to a mass audience in a way that
philosophy is not. While the performance of miracles does not prove specific claims about the creation of the universe, it can supplement demonstrations as evidence
that the person making those claims is more acquainted with the world than we
might be.
 
While Ibn Rushd is in the habit of defending earlier scholars like Aristotle and al-Fārābī when it comes to the relationship between philosophy of religion, he
strikes out on his own in a remarkable way when discussing his psychological theory.
Here, he tells us that there is only actually one human mind. This view came to be
known, among European scholars, as the doctrine of the unity of the intellect. However, it is easy to say that Ibn Rushd defends such a doctrine, but it is much
harder to say what he meant by it. As mentioned above, Ibn Rushd thinks that
philosophical demonstrates should give us access to what is necessarily true.
However, we can’t do this on the basis of experience. You may think all mallards have green heads because you have seen hundreds of them and they’ve all had green
heads, but this could easily be overturned by seeing a single female mallard. There is
nothing about the observation of green-headed mallards that guarantees the truth of
all mallards having green heads. This drove Plato to affirm the doctrine of anamnesis;
we can know universal truths because we were acquainted with the universal forms before our birth, and we merely recognize particulars as instances when we observe
things in the world. However, Ibn Rushd is most certainly not a Platonist, and this
means coming up with his own answer to how universal knowledge is possible. In
this case, he is driven to the position by three claims:
 
1.   Humans engage in abstract thought.
2.   Abstract thought is not possible for material beings.
3.   Humans are material beings.
 
232
While the first and third claim seem relatively straightforward, it may help
to explain why Ibn Rushd accepts the second claim. According to Aristotle, the
mind takes the shape of the thing one thinks about. For instance, if you see a possum
on the side of the road, you picture a possum in your mind. However, if this is right, then it seems difficult to explain how we come to think about things that are the
same shape as the mind. If the mind is, for example, brain-shaped, then thinking
about the brain would involve the mind coming to be brain-shaped. Unfortunately,
the mind is already brain-shaped, which means we were already thinking about the
brain. We know, however, from experience, that we don’t spend all of our free time thinking about any one particular thing, so the mind can’t have any one particular
shape. This leads Aristotle to conclude that the mind cannot be material because
material things have shape. Ibn Rushd, as a good Aristotelian, must explain how we
are able to have abstract and universal thought, and his answer is one common to many philosophers: draw a distinction. Here, our physical and particular bodies
engage in ‘cogitation’ by considering particular objects in the world, and this process
provides us with access to a universal intellect, shared by all, and capable of universal
knowledge.
 
Maimonides 
 
So far, we have been discussing philosophy during the Islamic Golden Age
in terms of it being ‘philosophy the Islamic world’ as opposed to ‘Islamic
philosophy’. This is for good reason. As we have already mentioned, the Islamic world (and the philosophical community within it) were very diverse during is
period. Al-Kindī’s team of translators at the House of Wisdom were primarily
Christian. Likewise, Al-Fārābī had both teachers and students who were Christian
philosophers. However, Judaism also played an important role in the intellectual life of the region at the time, and no Medieval Jewish philosopher has been more
influential than Maimonides (born Moses ben Maimon and also known by the
Hebrew Rambam). Like Ibn Rushd and Ibn Ṭufayl, Maimonides was an
Andalusian. Also like Ibn Rushd, Maimonides was born in Córdoba during the same time period and born to a family of religious legal scholars. However, when the
 
233
Almohads conquered al-Andalus, Maimonides’ family fled to Morocco in order to
find a home more tolerant of Judaism. Maimonides himself eventually ended up in
Cairo, where he resided for the rest of his life. There, he studied and wrote until
eventually securing a position as the physician to the Muslim rulers of the Egyptian Ayyubid dynasty. In this role, he was especially prolific; he spent his days treating the
ruling elite, would come home to find commoners waiting for him in order to be
treated and, after having worked his way through these patients, spent his evenings
writing on medicine.
 
Despite the religious differences between him and the Islamic thinkers whose work dominated Arabic philosophy; Maimonides takes onboard much of
what his predecessors say about the nature of God. For instance, he affirms al-Kindī’s
doctrine of the true One, and holds that God is a pure unity. Likewise, this leads
him, like al-Kindī, to support a negative theology. God’s utter unity means that we are, strictly speaking, wrong and limiting in attributing any particular attributes to
him. This seems to raise a problem for reconciling the doctrine of the true One with
the descriptions we get of God in the Hebrew bible. However, Maimonides argues
that these descriptions are actually of the world. For instance, when we are told that God is angry, we should understand this to be a description of how the conditions of
the world are in relation to us (e.g., inhospitable). This means that, while we can’t
speak to the attributes of God, we can come to knowledge of the world he created.
Thus, Maimonides has defended a role for philosophy in Judaism in the same way that his predecessors did within Islam. However, like in the case of the falsafa
tradition, this was not without controversy. Indeed, the term ‘Maimonidean
Controversy’ describes a technically ongoing debate in Jewish rabbinical scholarship
over the compatibility of philosophy and Judaism. While Jewish scholars still take
sides on the issue, with Maimonides being accused of idolatry and the study of philosophy and physics being variously banned at different points in different
communities across Europe, the controversy peaked by the early 1300’s, and
Maimonides is now considered to be among the greatest and most influential Jewish
philosophers of all time.
 
Maimonides’ connection to al-Kindī goes deeper than this though. In
addition to taking on board al-Kindī’s doctrine of the true One and its implications
for theology, Maimonides also follows him in addressing the question of the eternity
 
234 of the universe. However, here, Maimonides argues that philosophy cannot provide
us with demonstrative knowledge. While he does so through a series of arguments, it
will be enough for us to say that he doesn’t think that philosophy can settle the
matter. In these cases, we are justified in following what revelation reveals. Thus, philosophy can give us necessary truths (and we should interpret the Bible to be in
accordance with the truth that reason reveals), we can look to religion in order to
settle matters which philosophy leaves unresolved. This is not to say that religion is
subordinate to philosophy, but that philosophy should guide our interpretation of
religion. Because philosophy guarantees universal knowledge, and religion reveals only the truth, Maimonides holds that philosophy provides us with a standard to
assess which interpretations of the religion are true.
 
Yet, while so much philosophical, mathematical, and scientific progress was
accomplished during the Islamic Golden Age, it (like all historical periods) did come to an end. In 1258, Hulagu Khan laid siege to Baghdad. For thirteen days, the
Mongols worked to destroy as much of the city and as many of its inhabitants as
possible. The most populous city in the world at the time was literally decimated,
only recovering its one million inhabitants in the middle of the 20th century. The same applied to the knowledge that al-Mansur and his descendants were able to
amass in the House of Wisdom. The Tigris River was said to flow black with ink,
and a man on horseback could apparently ride across the river on the backs of
destroyed books. Despite some scholars managing to smuggle out as many as 400,000 texts, much more of this knowledge was destroyed than survived, and
sometimes simply to use the leather binding of the books to make sandals. In the
West, however, what ended the Arabic philosophical tradition was also responsible
for the full reemergence of philosophy in Europe. Christian forces were eventually
able to reconquer al-Andalus and, in doing so, were reintroduced to Greek works which had fallen away from prominence. Scholars discovering these, in some cases,
long lost Greek texts began scrambling to translate them into Latin and spread them
northward across Europe. Work like this, taken up by scholars like those comprising
the Toledo school of translators, served to move philosophy out of Spain and into France, Britain, and Germany. This renewed interest will, in turn, kickstart the
Medieval European philosophical tradition.

Medieval & 
 
Renaissance 
 
Philosophy 
 
When we discuss the history of philosophy, it can be helpful to divide our
timeline into distinct periods. Usually, these periods are supposed to roughly reflect
social boundaries set out by historically significant events. For instance, the Hellenistic period marks the time between the Macedonian empire of Alexander the
Great and the rise of Rome. However, we have already seen that historical periods do
not neatly map onto philosophical periods. The Presocratic philosopher Democritus
was actually a contemporary of Socrates, Platonism carries over from the classical period to the Hellenistic period, and many of the schools of thought which emerge
during the Hellenistic period remain dominant throughout the time of the Roman
empire. The Medieval period is no exception to this kind of controversy. For one
thing, scholars disagree about when exactly it starts and ends. However, it typically
refers to the period between the fall of the Western Roman empire and the Renaissance. Notice, though, that this means that we have already been discussing
Medieval philosophy when covering philosophy in the Islamic world. This reflects
the fact that these historical periods are not natural facts which historians uncover
but are negotiated.
 
Further, this negotiation has historically and unduly centered around events
in European history. Historians used to refer to Medieval times as the ‘Dark Ages’,
 
239 and this often gave people the impression that it was not a period with any real
scholarship or learning. However, the ‘dark’ in Dark Ages actually refers to the
historical record going dark, not intellectual activity. This period, in contrast to
others, saw less surviving historical sources than those which buttress it. However, as we have already seen, it can hardly be said of the Islamic world during this time that
there was no significant learning or advancement. Yet, we might still be tempted,
based on the previous discussion, to think that Europe had no major thinkers until
the rediscovery of Greek thought through the reconquest of al-Andalus. This
definitely did occur, and it had a profound impact on European philosophy, mathematics, and science. However, this is not to say that there weren’t people doing
philosophy in Europe in the time immediately prior to this point. In fact, Medieval
Europe was a site of enormous intellectual progress and innovation.
 
This brings us to another issue with the timeline we set out for when the Medieval period occurred. It is one thing to say that it lasted from the fall of the
Western Roman empire through to the Renaissance, but this only raises the
question: which Renaissance? Introductory history classes will refer to the Italian
Renaissance of the 15th and 16th century as ‘the Renaissance’ and, as such, students are often inclined to think that it was the only major ‘rebirth’ of thought in Europe.
In fact, there was also a prior ‘Carolingian Renaissance’ as far back as the 8th
century. The fall of the Western Roman empire had left a power vacuum which
sought to be filled. Among those vying for power was Charlemagne, king of the Franks (a people from modern day France and Germany). When Charlemagne
proved victorious over a once-again unified Europe, he worked to reestablish a
system of education across the continent. As part of this effort, Charlemagne and the
Franks employed a large group of now mostly anonymous Irish monks.56 These
scholars worked to reproduce what Greek knowledge had survived the fall of Rome and began teaching students according to a curriculum they derived from the works
of Aristotle that they had access to. This system survives to us today as the modern
university system. However, this system would not fully be realized until the

240 complete reintroduction of Greek thought through Muslim-controlled al-Andalus.
This kicked off the high point of Medieval philosophy, which lasted until the time of
the Italian Renaissance and Protestant Reformation. However, while all of these
boundary drawing issues are of ongoing scholarly dispute, we can at least say that the scholars that are discussed in this chapter represent the time period in European
history after the Neoplatonists we have already covered, that many were heavily
influenced by philosophical work done during the Islamic Golden Age, and that
they set the stage for the period of philosophy which comes after them.
 
Anselm of Canterbury 
 
We mentioned in our discussion of Hellenistic philosophy that Boethius represented the direction that European philosophy was headed because his work
shows us the influence that Christianity was gaining over philosophical thought in
the region. However, Boethius wasn’t, strictly speaking, the first major Christian
philosopher. That title might, instead, go to Augustine of Hippo. He lived roughly two hundred years prior to Boethius and was a native of Thagaste, in what is now
modern-day Algeria. He wrote on a wide range of topics including just war theory
(or the area of philosophy concerned with when and how just wars ought to be
fought) and on trinitarianism. However, despite the work of Augustine, Medieval European philosophy can be said to fully come into its own with Anselm of
Canterbury.57
 
Anselm of Canterbury was born in what is now modern-day Italian Alps.
Prior to his birth, his family had been involved in the political infighting of the
region, and his parents’ marriage was likely an effort to resolve these disputes. Anselm was apparently drawn to religious life at a young age; trying and failing to
secure the permission of his father to join a monastery. Eventually, after his father’s
 
57 Despite being supplanted by later philosophers in the minds of many Medieval thinkers, Augustine did have some notable followers. Included among these is the Italian philosopher Bonaventure, who drew on Augustine’s view in order to argue that Christian theology is a proper branch of Aristotelian science. 
 
241 death, Anselm was put in a position to join Bec Abbey in France, under the tutelage
of a well-known jurist named Lanfranc. Anselm had been drawn to Bec Abbey
because Lanfranc was a fellow Italian and because he had become the closest thing to
an academic celebrity as one could hope during the time period. However, Lanfranc was quickly called elsewhere, and Anselm was left to himself at Bec. There, he began
to establish himself as a philosopher and writer at the behest of his monastic
brethren. He apparently had a reputation as a teacher and was asked by his fellow
monks to write down his explanations of Christian doctrine so that they could share
and preserve them. This reputation, along with some political motivations, was enough to see him follow Lanfranc once again; this time in being appointed to the
seat of British religious power as the Archbishop of Canterbury. While the rest of his
life serves as an interesting story about the relationship between religion and politics
during this time, our concerns are primarily with his philosophical thought and, in this regard, the importance of his legacy is hard to overstate. Primarily this influence
is a matter of two things: his role as the father of scholasticism and his development
of the ontological argument for God’s existence.
 
While the Irish monks of the Holy Roman empire had already established the university system in accordance with Aristotelianism, Catholic authorities were
still skeptical of the influence of Greek Pagan thought. However, we saw that Islamic
scholars were able to reconcile Aristotle’s teachings with Islam and, in doing so,
legitimize philosophy within the religious order of their society. This same reconciliation process occurs (with some influence from those Islamic scholars)
between Aristotelianism and Catholicism in Europe. This combined philosophical
tradition (bringing together Aristotle’s thought and Christian doctrine) has come to
be known as Scholasticism, and the scholastic school will dominate European
thought for several hundred years. However, with Anselm of Canterbury this movement is only just beginning.
 
With regards to the ontological argument, it will help to first get clear
about which one we are talking about. Technically speaking, any argument which
appeals to the nature of a thing or things is an ontological argument, and any argument that attempts to justify believing in God on the basis of his nature is an
ontological argument for God’s existence. In this way, Ibn Sīnā’s Proof of the
Truthful is an ontological argument for God’s existence because it is argued on the
 
242 basis of God’s nature as the necessary existent. Nevertheless, Anselm’s ontological
argument has come to be called ‘the ontological argument’ (for God’s existence)
because of its profound influence. Still, we have not narrowed the subject matter
down enough. We should be careful to distinguish two different formulations of the argument. First, there is the ontological argument which is now commonly and
famously remembered. Second, there is a more precise version. In fact, these two
arguments are quite different. The former is important because it persists as a topic
in philosophy and draws considerable attention, the latter is important because it is
far more interesting and persuasive, and because it represents what Anselm actually thought. First, the ontological argument as it is commonly understood:
 
1.   God is that which no greater can be conceived.
2.   It is greater to exist in reality than to only exist in the mind.
3.   Therefore, God exists in reality.
 
This argument is quite simple. God is the best possible thing we could
imagine. Yet, if we imagine God not to exist, then we could still imagine a thing like
God that also existed in reality. However, this second thing would be better than the
God we could only imagine and, if God is the greatest conceivable thing, then God must actually be the second thing, which we specified exists. One problem with this
argument was pointed out by Gaunilo of Marmoutiers. He provided a similar argument:
 
1.   There is an island which no greater can be conceived.
2.   It is greater to exist in reality than to only exist in the mind.
3.   Therefore, the greatest possible island exists in reality.
 
The issue, according to Gaunilo, is that Anselm’s line of reasoning can
prove the existence of anything. However, the greatest possible island would have
plenty of room for everyone to spread out and have privacy on the beach. No matter how much coastline you add to the beach, we could still imagine an island with more
coastline and, therefore, more privacy on the beach. In the end, this means that there
must actually be some island with an infinite coastline. This seems to be a major
problem with the argument that we have seen. However, there is still the matter of the second version.
 
243
When we look closely at Anselm’s text, called the Proslogion, he had already
taken himself to have shown the existence of God prior to the appearance of this
argument. Like Ibn Sīnā, Anselm has a particular view about what kind of thing God
is, and he thinks that this definition of God will justify belief in God’s existence. In this way, the prior argument that Anselm provides for the existence of God is also an
ontological argument, it just isn’t the ontological argument above. You can see
Anselm’s prior argument below:
 
1. Beings can be greater or lesser than other beings.
 
2.   There must either be a greatest possible being or an infinite number
of beings, each better than the last.
 
3. There can’t be an infinite number of beings.
 
4. Therefore, there must be a greatest possible being.
 
Now that Anselm takes himself to have proven the existence of a greatest
possible being, he can identify that being with God, and has thus proven that God
(as he conceives of him) exists. Where Sīnā had defined God as the necessary existent
and then derived his existence from that definition, Anselm has defined God as the greatest possible being and derived his existence from this definition. With that
argument out of the way, Anselm then turns to what else we can say about God’s
nature. In this case, he actually follows Ibn Sīnā in thinking that God exists
necessarily. It is not enough to say that God exists, but that he must exist. This has the added benefit of satisfying Ibn Sīnā’s criteria for God as the necessary existent
and therefore meaning that Christians can help themselves to the Proof of the
Truthful in addition to the argument that Anselm has already given. Accordingly,
this is Anselm’s argument for the necessity of God’s existence:
 
1.   God is that which no greater can be conceived.
 
2.   A being which necessarily exists is greater than one that only
contingently exists.
 
3.   Therefore, God exists necessarily.
 
Notice that this argument is less vulnerable to Gaunilo’s objection. For one thing, it doesn’t even try to prove the existence of God. It assumes (from a previous
 
244 argument) that God exists in some way and merely concludes that his existence must
be necessary. The same cannot be said for Gaunilo’s island, since it hasn’t already
been shown to exist. Likewise, the argument only applies to the greatest possible
thing (of which there can only be one). If the argument applies to an island, then that island is also as great as God, which means that God isn’t the greatest possible
thing. Yet, despite possibly avoiding Gaunilo’s criticisms, Anselm’s ontological
argument will face further criticism throughout the history of philosophy. We will
have to wait and see whether those criticisms apply to his actual argument, or only to
the version that is more commonly remembered.
 
Héloïse d'Argenteuil & Peter Abelard 
 
After Anselm, the next central figure in the establishment of scholasticism is
Peter Abelard. However, as we will see, it is difficult to untangle his life or his
philosophical contributions completely from the life and thought of Héloïse
d'Argenteuil. Abelard was born into a noble family near Nantes on the coast of France. Despite his father’s wishes for him to follow in his footsteps, and to become
a knight, the young Abelard began wandering the countryside learning from and
debating those he came across. These travels eventually led him to Roscelin of 
Compiègne, who had been accused of heresy by Anselm of Canterbury and who took Abelard on as a student. While under his tutelage, Abelard began to expand on
Roscelin’s ideas, and to develop this into an answer to the hot topic of his day: the
problem of universals. However, Abelard’s instruction eventually passed from
Roscelin to William of Champeaux, then in charge of education at the cathedral school of Notre Dame in Paris. While Abelard claimed that his relationship with
William of Champeaux declined because of his teacher’s professional jealousy, others
claim that it was due to Abelard’s own arrogance. Whatever the case, the two would
eventually develop a lifelong philosophical feud. This disagreement later turned into a series of public debates and a nearly successful attempt on Abelard’s part to replace
William of Champeaux in his role at Notre Dame. While he did eventually get the
 
245 job, it was not at the professional expense of William of Champeaux, and only after a
number of other public disputes with Roscelin and Anselm.
 
It was while at Notre Dame that Abelard met Héloïse d'Argenteuil. She
had a reputation as the most intelligent and well-educated woman in Paris, knowing
Latin, Greek, and Hebrew in addition to her native tongue. Héloïse was living under the care of a stern and possessive uncle and Abelard had risen to the highest point of
European intellectual life. She caught his eye on the basis of her intellect and
apparently despite the beauty of the great many people attempting to win Abelard’s
affection. The two began a secret affair which eventually spilled over into the public when Abelard’s poetry for her became famous across France. Héloïse’s uncle insisted
that they call off the relationship but Abelard and Héloïse continued, having a son in
secret which they named Astrolabe after the scientific instrument used to calculate
the positions of the stars.
 
Abelard proposed marriage as a way to appease Héloïse’s uncle, but Héloïse
worried that a marriage would hurt Abelard’s philosophical career. The result was a
private marriage, which they hid from the public and from her uncle. However,
despite their best efforts, this marriage eventually found its way into the public attention and Héloïse denied the claim to her uncle, who was furious that the
relationship had continued. When the uncle became abusive, Abelard sent Héloïse
into hiding at a convent. The uncle, in turn, responded by paying a group of men to
break into Abelard’s home and castrate him, effectively ending any chance at a
relationship with Héloïse. In shame, Abelard renounced his position at Notre Dame and joined a monastery.
 
He remained a monk for a considerable amount of time, developing his
philosophical ideas and keeping up a now famous correspondence with Héloïse. These letters discuss their love for one another, the circumstances which they found
themselves in, and matters of philosophy and theology. Abelard encouraged Héloïse
to take vows at the convent in which she had been hiding and to remain there as a
nun. Meanwhile, his work led him into further disputes with the church and with
his philosophical peers. He was eventually excommunicated by Pope Innocent II, along with his followers, and ordered to remain silent on philosophical matters.
Friends fought to have the excommunication reversed, and were successful, but
 
246
Abelard died shortly after from disease. Alone and sick at the priory of St. Marcel, his
last words were recorded as “I don’t know”. Shortly after his death, Héloïse and
another of Abelard’s friends managed to get the charges of heresy reversed by the
Pope, and Héloïse was eventually buried in the same grave as Abelard; reunited at last. The site of their bodies, on the eastern side of Paris, has become a well-known
destination for lovers and for the lovelorn, who leave notes at the crypt. Likewise,
their correspondence and their story persisted as a powerful example of courtly love
through Medieval history.
 
In terms of Abelard’s philosophical contributions, there are two which are considered most significant: the development of nominalism as an answer to the
problem of universals, and the development of a deontological theory of ethics. We
encountered the problem of universals before, when Boethius raised it in his
commentaries on Porphyry, but we said then that it can trace its lineage back at least to Plato. The problem concerns the relationship between individuals (e.g., a
particular lizard) and their essential categories (e.g., the category ‘lizard’). Plato had
argued that these categories are immaterial universal forms which are more real than
the physical particulars of the material world. However, Plato had also convinced many people not to accept his theory of the forms. In another self-critical dialogue,
Parmenides, Plato raises a problem for his own account which has come to be
known as the third man argument. In this case, we are asked to think of a set of
beautiful things; let’s say, 1) the northern lights, 2) a hawk ‘on the wing’ (that is, in flight), and 3) Spring at the Great Divide. Imagine that this is a complete list of all of
the beautiful things in existence, and that they are beautiful because they participate
in the form of beauty. Accordingly, the universal category ‘beauty’ can be said to
have three members. However, Plato would also tell us that the form of beauty itself
is beautiful. This, in turn, means that the category must include the form of beauty itself and, thus, four things. Unfortunately, this means that the category which
includes those four things is now the form of beauty. Accordingly, this expanded set
of beautiful things is also beautiful, which means that it must also contain itself.
Thus, there must be a category of beauty which contains five things. As you can imagine, this problem persists infinitely, and it persists for every form. The resulting
picture is quite a metaphysical mess, and the argument, when picked up by Aristotle,
 
247 is damning in the eyes of later philosophers (due in no small part to the fact that
many of these philosophers are Aristotelians).
 
In his time, Aristotle had overturned this picture of the world and placed
the particulars in the primary position as substances. However, this still left later
Aristotelians, like the scholastics, with the problem of what should be said about the reality of these categories. Particulars are real and are primary; does that mean that
universals don’t exist at all or that they have some kind of secondary existence? Put
differently, when we say that the Dodo went extinct, do we mean 1) that all of the
birds which we call Dodos are no more, or 2) when the last of those birds died, it was something more than the death of one bird (namely, it was also the demise of a
species). While this explanation offers only two possible responses, philosophers in
Medieval Europe devised a range of answers to this question. Abelard’s answer to
this question is most in line with the first option, and that philosophical position has come to be known as nominalism.
 
Nominalism, generally, is the view that universals are just names (that is, a product of language) that we use to refer to a group of particulars. Accordingly,
there is no deeper reality to Dodo as a category than there is if we thought of cars currently being driven by Susans and named those ‘Susamobiles’. Both are universal
categories, and both merely pick out a group of individuals. Abelard defends
nominalism by arguing that realism about universals is self-contradictory. Consider
the universal ‘animal’. If this is real, then there is a real thing containing rationality
(insofar as the category ‘animal’ contains humans) and irrationality (insofar as it contains ‘donkeys’). Accordingly, ‘animal’ contains rationality and irrationality, and
this is contradictory. Meanwhile, if universals are just names for common features,
then ‘animal’ is just a label we apply to the features particulars share in common.
‘Animal’ doesn’t contain rationality or irrationality in any real sense, it’s merely a word for what those particulars have in common.
 
Despite the strange and metaphysical nature of this problem, the dispute is
not without consequences. For instance, Abelard is thought to have developed and
expanded on this account based on the work of Roscelin of Compiègne. In this case, Roscelin had raised similar worries about trinitarianism. Christians talk about God
as a single unified thing and, at the same time, three things (i.e., God the Father,
 
248
Jesus, and the Holy Spirit). Roscelin thought that saying that the universal category
which all three are members of is real meant that God the Father and the Holy Spirit
were also incarnated in Jesus. It was this claim that drove Anselm of Canterbury to
accuse Roscelin of heresy. Anselm argued that, if the three members of the trinity lacked some real underlying unity, then the trinity involved there being three, not
one, God. Eventually, Roscelin retracted his views for fear of death, but this did not
stop Abelard from extending the doctrine to the problem of universals (despite the
controversy).
 
As mentioned above, Abelard is also remembered for developing a system of
deontology. In this case, a deontological theory of ethics refers to any philosophical system which argues that morality is fundamentally about rules. We have seen
ancient philosophers like Aristotle and Kongzi defend virtue ethics, which argues
that morality is fundamentally about one’s character, but Abelard presents us with the first philosophical defense of rules as the basis of moral duty and moral appraisal.
To be clear, there were earlier deontological systems of ethics. Euthyphro had
defended a divine command theory, in which we should simply do what the gods
love. Likewise, the ten commandments represent a system of moral rules, and so does the golden rule, or the principle which tells us to treat others the way we would want
to be treated. Abelard’s contribution is not that he is the first person to articulate a
moral rule, but that he is among the first to defend rules in general as the basis for
morality. Also among those early defenders of deontology is Héloïse, and it is clear from their correspondence that they developed their theories in dialogue with one
another.
 
Héloïse recognizes that we might be tempted to think that actions are
morally good or bad. Here, she uses the example of their own affair. Given their
background Medieval Christian beliefs, both thinkers regard their actions as immoral in some sense. However, Héloïse notices that they were motivated to do these actions
according to a good motivation: love. By contrast, at the time that she is writing this,
she has taken on the life of a nun, but her heart is still filled with lust for Abelard. In
this way, she is living a life of good actions, but her intentions are impure. This raises the question: should we blame her for the well-intentioned bad actions of her early
life or her seemingly good later life filled with immoral thoughts? Héloïse’s answer is
that we should evaluate people based on the spirit in which they do things, not
 
249
necessarily on the particular things they do.58  That one’s intentions are what matters
in assigning them with praise or blame will become a hallmark feature of
deontological systems throughout history.
 
Hildegard of Bingen 
 
Hildegard of Bingen was born in a small town in the winegrowing region
of Germany near the French border. Her family were from the lower nobility, and she is said to have been the youngest of ten children. However, even if she was the
last, she was certainly not the least. At a young age, she began experiencing visions
which would continue throughout her life. In them, she described seeing a powerful
light which spread across the sky and out amongst the peoples of the world. It is likely that these visions were responsible for her parents’ decision to enter her into a
monastery because she was enlisted sometime between the age of eight and fourteen.
 
While living as a nun, she was educated in reading, writing, theology, and
music. Likewise, for most of her life, she avoided telling others of her visions and confided about them only to her superior. When this superior passed away,
Hildegard was unanimously elected to replace her and, in this role, sought to move
the convent in order for the group to secure more independence. This effort led to
considerable conflict between Hildegard and those in power; with Hildegard at one point paralyzed and believing that it was the consequence of God’s unhappiness at
her failures. Nevertheless, she was eventually able to secure the relocation and would
later be made a saint in the Catholic church. Beyond her religious and philosophical
significance, she also wrote on medicine and biology, invented her own constructed
language, and was possibly the most prolific musical composer of the Middle Ages.
 
58 This idea was famously taken up in the Early Modern period by the philosopher Immanuel Kant, who developed his own influential deontological theory. More can be read about him and his moral philosophy in the “Immanuel Kant” chapter. 
 
250
Many scholars refer to Hildegard as a Christian mystic, and, in that way, she
is not entirely unlike Rābi’a of Basra.59 Both were women, both were religious
figures, and both engaged in mystical practices during the Medieval period.
However, the similarities between their thoughts are actually greater than that. We have already seen that Sufi philosophy is closely related to Neoplatonism. The same
is true of Hildegard’s model of the cosmos. Indeed, she takes on board the
Neoplatonic theory of emanation that we saw developed under Plotinus and
expanded on by Proclus and al-Fārābī. On her version, all of creation (the
‘macrocosm’) is present within each of us (the ‘microcosm’). While she does spend a considerable amount of time and space in her writing detailing which parts of the
body correspond to which parts of the world, this is not merely a helpful allegory for
understanding humans or the universe. Each part of the world embodies God’s
creation of it and emanates that creation through us. This, she explains, describes the relationship between the humors of the body and the soul. We saw that al-Kindī
drew on the Greek medical theory of humors to explain how music was capable of
healing. Hildegard’s account takes this Pythagorean influence (in thinking that the
world is ordered according to a musical harmony) and explains it physically. Just as the harmony in music can create harmony in the body through the humors for al-
Kindī (an idea which is also at home in Hildegard’s work), Hildegard also tells us that
the harmony in nature can result in harmony in the body through medicinal herbs.
 
59 Hildegard is also often compared to Catherine of Siena, another medieval Christian mystic. Catherine is known for, among other things, defending the doctrine of divine providence. This is the view that all events in the universe are governed over by God and, as such, work towards the good. We have already seen, in Saggil-kīnam-ubbib’s “Babylonian Theodicy” and Boethius’ The Consolation of Philosophy, that this view is often defended as a response to the problem of evil. However, reconciling the existence of evil with God’s providence is another issue. Catherine’s answer is that the evil that humans do is our own responsibility because we freely choose it. While God does allow it, he only does so in cases where that suffering serves some other benefit (e.g., revealing the sinner’s sinful nature, testing the faith of those sinned against, etc.) and never for the purposes of that suffering taking place. This is a rather unique application of the medieval Christian philosopher Thomas Aquinas’ doctrine of double effect, according to which it is morally permissible for a person to cause harm when it is a side-effect of their working to accomplish some good. Thomas Aquinas’ views will be discussed at length later in this chapter.  
 
251
This model of nature, which says that humans mirror the universe in their
composition, can be called the theory of macrocosm and microcosm.
 
However, we might wonder how all of these different theories of emanation
explain the disorder in the world. The broad strokes of the theory reflect our
intuitions that the world isn’t a totally chaotic mess but, if God is constantly emanating order to the world, how do things get disordered in the first place. Al-
Kindī and Hildegard have explained why healing works, but this just raises the
question of why health problems arise in the first place. Hildegard is sensitive to this
worry and addresses it by appealing to Christian doctrine. According to her, humanity’s choice to sin introduced dysfunction into the chain of emanation. This
allows her theory to strike some balance between adequately explaining the order of
the universe without attributing a total and lawlike order to the world. However, this
picture also has another interesting consequence. Hildegard has already argued that there is a deep connection between the harmony of nature and, through the body,
the harmony of the soul. Notice that, since God’s goodness emanates from the
natural world’s harmony, it is in our physical and spiritual interest that the natural
world remains harmonious. The same thing applies in the case of sin; moral error and environmental disunity are tied together. Hildegard’s model of the world
provides us with a spiritual, moral, and physical justification for environmental ethics. This is the area of philosophy concerned with understanding humanity’s
obligations to the natural world. For Hildegard, the disorder we see in the natural world is the result of our moral choices, and repairing ourselves and that world are
both two sides of the same project: our moral self-development.
 
By further developing the theory of emanation, and deriving a framework
for environmental ethics from it, Hildegard of Bingen’s philosophical work shows us
that Neoplatonism continued to thrive through the Medieval period. While it has its origins in Plotinus’ efforts to put Paganism in a position to compete philosophically
with Christianity, it continues to influence a number of religions for the next
millennium after Plotinus’ death. Beyond this, these later religious philosophers
manage to elaborate and defend the view, synthesizing it with the metaphysics of their own spiritual practices, and deriving new and interesting conclusions from an
ancient model of the world.
 
252
Thomas Aquinas 
 
If the lives of Peter Abelard and Hildegard of Bingen are characterized by
their willingness to fight with the authorities of the church, the life of Thomas Aquinas is quite the opposite. In fact, he had to fight in order to fully join the
church in the way that he wanted. He was born to a noble family in the then
independent Kingdom of Sicily. While it was common for the youngest son of noble houses like these to enter into the clergy, Thomas did depart significantly from his
family’s wishes in how he did it. Starting at the age of five, he was educated in
preparation to join the Benedictine Order. However, in the half century prior to his
birth, widespread corruption among the clergy had led some hardliners to form a new order. This community dedicated themselves more fully to a life of poverty and
to defending the doctrines of the faith. While Mass was held in Latin, the new
Dominican Order traveled the countryside preaching in the native languages of those
they encountered. This practice, of defending religious belief using rational
argumentation, has become known as apologetics. By the time that Thomas was nineteen, strong and widespread recruitment efforts by the Dominicans had
convinced him that he should join the order. While his family had always intended
for him to have a religious life, they saw his joining the Dominican order as a renunciation of them in favor of a strange new group of religious fanatics. While the
Dominicans worked to move him away from his family to Paris, Thomas’ mother
instructed her other sons to kidnap him on the side of the road, and to return him to
their castle. This plot was successful, and Thomas was imprisoned there for around a year. While imprisoned, the family was desperate to break his will. In one scheme,
they arranged for Thomas to be visited by a prostitute so that he could be tempted
out of a life of strict religious piety. We are told that he took a burning log from the
fireplace and chased her away before using the ash from the log to inscribe a cross
onto his door. Eventually, his mother relented and enabled his escape during the night. Thomas fled through a window and headed to Rome and, eventually, to Paris.
 
There, at the University of Paris, Aquinas was able to study under the
philosopher Albert the Great (also known as Albertus Magnus), who was
developing a theory of Aristotle which did not draw on Islamic commentators. Aquinas threw himself headfirst into this project. While he was bullied at the school,
 
253 both for his appearance and for his quiet temperament (being called a ‘dumb ox’ by
his peers), he managed to impress Magnus, and was appointed regent master in
theology. After taking up a number of teaching positions in Rome, he was sent back
to Paris to confront the rise in influence of Aristotle and Ibn Rushd. Aquinas, himself, was a committed Aristotelian, but his efforts focused on where he disagreed
with ‘the philosopher’ and ‘the commentator’: the eternity of the universe. It was
also during this time that he finished his greatest work, and one which stands as the
most influential in Medieval philosophy: the Summa Theologiae. However, his
prolific career was cut short when, in his late forties, he was struck by a falling tree branch on the way back from a council. He died shortly after due to complications
from the injuries he sustained. Despite this, his work was declared the official
philosophical position of the Catholic church by Pope Leo the XIII in 1879, and he
is remembered as the patron saint of philosophers today.60
 
While Aquinas wrote a tremendous amount, and on a very wide range of
topics, some of Aquinas’s most significant philosophical contributions concern
issues which we are already quite familiar with, the problem of universals and the
existence of God. While Platonism about universals (that is, the view that universals are more real than particulars) had fallen out of fashion, Peter Abelard’s nominalism
was still seen as running counter to the dominant Christian position. As we saw,
Roscelin had been accused of heresy when his early version of nominalism was seen
as leading to the denial of the trinity. This divide leaves an opening for a weaker form of realism which can be accepted as compatible with trinitarianism. Aquinas
attempted to occupy this space in the debate by forming a position which has come
to be known as moderate realism. As we might expect, Aquinas’ solution
represents a return to Aristotle. Aristotle’s hylomorphism had said that there is no
universal form which exists on its own the way that Plato would argue, but also that essential natures are more than linguistic convention (the way that Abelard argued).
 
60 A similarly influential role was played in Eastern Orthodox Christianity, though without an official endorsement, by the late antiquity Turkish philosopher Gregory of Nyssa. While Gregory’s work predates the ‘East-West Schism’ between the two groups in 1054, his impact is much greater in the Eastern Orthodox church because the church was unaffected by Aquinas’ later interpretation of Aristotle. This gives, in the views of some scholars, Neoplatonism (by way of Gregory) a more significant role in church doctrine as opposed to Roman Catholicism’s focus on Aristotelianism.  
 
254
There is no separate realm of the forms, which contains the form of the dog, and
which all particular dogs participate in. On the other hand, being a dog is different
than being a ‘Susamobile’ (a car currently being driven by someone named Susan).
Namely, because being a dog represents having a real essential form. According to moderate realism, the essential categories of things are part of the individual natures
of particular beings. Accordingly, there is an essential form that represents what it
means to be a Dodo bird, but that form died when the last Dodo bird died. By
contrast, Plato would argue that the form is eternal and lives on after the death of all
of the mortal particulars, and Abelard would argue that our positing an essential nature which makes these particulars Dodo birds is merely a linguistic convention
like inventing the work ‘Susamobile’. In his way, Aquinas’ moderate realism allows
us to talk about essences without having to argue for the existence of the realm of the
forms. Thus, by taking on a position which is seen as compatible with Catholic doctrine, Aquinas is seen as cementing scholasticism as the dominant view in
Medieval Christendom. This establishes Aristotle as the secular philosophical
framework to accompany and support Catholic theology.61 
 
Aquinas’ Aristotelianism is also seen in his account of the relationship between philosophy and theology. Aristotle and Christianity have both argued that
God is the cause of the world. However, we have also seen that there is a wide range
of answers as to what else we can say about God. The Mu’tazila school’s negative
theology tells us that we can only know what God is not. By contrast, we have also seen Ibn Sīnā and Anselm of Canterbury argue that we can know that God exists
necessarily. Aquinas’ position limits what philosophy can say about the nature of
God only to what Aristotle and Christianity have in common: that he is the cause of
the universe. God caused the universe to come into being and we can, by looking at
it, come to know of his existence through his role as a causal agent. For Aquinas, natural philosophy reveals that nature is crafted, and we can discern God’s creative
role through his creation. We can call attempts to demonstrate the existence of God
 
61 Historically, Aquinas was seen as completing the overthrow of Augustine of Hippo’s dominance over Catholic doctrine and putting Ibn Sina and Aristotle in his place. In recent times, this strict distinction between Augustine and Aquinas has been called into question. For instance, the Belgian philosopher Henry of Ghent, writing shortly after Aquinas, in many ways worked to synthesize the two views.  
 
255 by looking at facts about the natural world natural theology, and we can understand this as a subset of rational theology. However, beyond its work in natural
theology, philosophy is of little use to the theologian according to Aquinas.
Philosophy can only show us that God exists; it can’t show us his essence. Instead, our chance to come to knowledge of God’s essence is in the afterlife. Nevertheless,
proving God’s existence is still a great accomplishment if successful and, for that,
Aquinas believes himself to be a philosopher up to the task.
 
When it comes to the matter of God’s existence, Aquinas’ contributions are
most frequently remembered in terms of the five ways. These are five arguments he gives for God’s existence. However, while these have been expanded on and further
developed by later philosophers in order to be more rigorous and persuasive, they
were likely not intended to be totally convincing to disbelievers. We should
remember that Aquinas is writing as an instructor to others in a convent. Accordingly, the audience of the Summa Theologiae is already convinced of the
existence of God and already accept a number of premises which are rooted in either
Christian doctrine or Aristotelian scholasticism. As such, the five ways were
probably intended to capture a few rough ways of reasoning which establish that God can be known through natural theology, not that God must exist. With that
being said, they are still worth mentioning here because they were so influential
among later philosophers; either in generating responses to them or in others
working to turn them into more complete proofs of God’s existence. First among the
five ways is the argument from motion, which is a form of cosmological argument. We first encountered the cosmological argument for God’s existence
when we discussed the Nyāya school philosopher Udayana, but Aquinas’ version is
closer to Aristotle’s argument. In fact, he even adopts Aristotle’s language of an
‘unmoved mover’. The argument is as follows:
 
1.   There is movement in nature.
 
2.   If there is movement in nature, then there must be a first cause of
that movement.
 
3.   Therefore, there is a first cause of movement in nature (God).
 
256
It is important to note that motion, here, means more than just a change in
spatial location. Given Aquinas’ background endorsement of Aristotelianism, the
motion that he is primarily concerned with is the movement of things from one way
in potentiality to that way in actuality. This could mean spatial location (e.g., something was here in actuality and there in potentiality, and now it is there in
actuality and here in potentiality), but it could also refer to any other instance of
change. You can also see that it is quite similar to Aristotle’s reason for thinking that
there is an unmoved mover. The same can be said for the second of Aquinas’ five
ways, the argument from universal causation:
 
1.   Everything in the world has a cause.
 
2.   If everything in the world has a cause, there must be a first cause of
things in the world.
 
3.   Therefore, there is a first cause of the world (God).
 
Notice that the argument from universal causation is also a cosmological
argument, as it attempts to show God’s existence by appealing to facts about the
beginning of the universe. However, while the first two arguments are similar to
what has already been said by Aristotle (and Udayana), the third of Aquinas’ ways
most closely resembles Ibn Sīnā’s Proof of the Truthful. This is the argument from 
contingency:
 
1.   Things in the world exist contingently.
 
2.   If the things in our world exist contingently, then the fact of their
existence is contingent on something which is, itself, not
contingent.
 
3.   Therefore, there is some non-contingent (necessary thing)
responsible for the existence of things in our world (God).
 
Aquinas follows up this ontological argument with another. This fourth
way is the argument from degrees. This is similar to the first part of Anselm of
Canterbury’s ontological argument. It is shown below:
 
257
1.   Things are reasonably said to be greater or lesser than other things.
 
2.   If things are reasonably said to be greater or lesser than other things,
then there must be a greatest thing.
 
3.   Therefore, there must be a greatest thing (God).
 
Finally, Aquinas’ fifth way has come to be known as the teleological 
argument (or the argument from design). Technically speaking, there could be different kinds of teleological arguments in the same way that there are different
versions of cosmological and ontological arguments. These are ways of categorizing
proofs of God’s existence. In the same way that a cosmological argument concerns the origins of the universe and ontological arguments concern the nature of God,
teleological arguments are based in the apparent design and purposiveness of the
universe. However, while teleological arguments are a family of proofs, Aquinas’
version is often referred to as ‘the teleological argument’, evidence of its influence. The argument is listed below:
 
1.   Everything in nature is ordered to achieve a goal.
 
2.   If everything in nature is ordered to achieve a goal, then there must
be some designer responsible for ordering the world.
 
3.   Therefore, there is some designer responsible for ordering the world
(God).
 
As you can see, many of the five ways have their roots in older arguments
from Anselm of Canterbury, Aristotle, or Ibn Sīnā. Likewise, many of them would be further developed by other thinkers. However, Aquinas bringing all of these
arguments together and organizing them by category is a significant contribution in
its own right, and his impact within the Catholic church has made his presentation
of them an especially influential part of the history of philosophy.
 
258
John Duns Scotus & William of Ockham 
 
Aquinas’ work on the problem of universals was an attempt to strike an
intermediate position between Platonic realism and Abelard’s nominalism, but he
was not alone in doing so. The other most famous realist account of universals was
put forward by the philosopher John Duns Scotus. Compared to those we have
already discussed, very little is known about Scotus’ life. He was born in Duns in Scotland (from which he derives his name) around the time that Aquinas was
working as a papal theologian in Rome. We know that he attended Oxford and later
took up a teaching position at the University of Paris. His time at the University of
Paris was apparently short lived however, as he was briefly removed from the post due to his siding with the Pope in a property tax dispute between the church and the
King of France. Despite getting the job back a year later, he mysteriously and quickly
departed again; this time to Cologne in Germany, and without taking many
belongings. The circumstances of his unexpected death several years later (in his early forties) are as elusive to us now as the circumstances of his leaving Paris. Despite no
definitive answer, it would later become a common rumor that he was buried alive
after he fell into a coma. On this account, Scotus had a servant who knew that he was
susceptible to becoming comatose but, when the servant was absent on the day that it actually happened, others wrongly believed that he had passed. However, it is now
considered likely that this story is a myth.
 
As already mentioned, Scotus is remembered, in no small part, because of
his developing an alternative version of realism about universals, distinct from that of
either Plato or Aquinas. We have been talking about universals as precisely that: universal. Indeed, the problem has come to be called the ‘problem of universals’.
However, the range of responses to this problem shows us that the name is actually
not quite right. For some realists, we are only concerned with ‘common essences’ like
‘duck’, ‘oak’, and ‘human’. These categories are essential in a way that ‘Susamobile’ and ‘tall’ are not. By contrast, a nominalist like Abelard will deny this distinction.
For him, being a duck is no more essential to a thing’s nature than being tall is.
Scotus’ answer to the problem of universals is to assert the reality of common
essences, but to deny that these essences are eternal and universal. In this way, Scotus follows Aquinas and Aristotle in thinking that common essences exist within
 
259 individuals. However, Scotus’ account differs in two respects. First, it also provides
us with an answer as to how we come to form universal judgements on the basis of
particular essences. It is one thing to say that all of the particular snakes each contain
the form of snake, but how do we come to know the form of snake in spite of individual differences between particular snakes? The answer, for Scotus, is that the
mind takes up the individual essences contained within particulars and forms
universal concepts. These concepts work because they are grounded in the real
essences contained within individuals, and they are universal because the mind is able
to abstract those essences away from the accidental features of the particulars we encounter in the world. Secondly, Scotus also provides us with an account for how
individuals exist in the first place. If all of the individual cats contain a common
essence, then why do some have a calico color pattern and others have a blue point
color pattern? Here, Scotus tells us that, in addition to containing a common
essence, individuals also contain a haecceity which ‘contracts’ with that common essence. This haecceity is an individual essence or a thing that makes this thing this 
thing. By contrast, we have so far only thought of common natures as essential,
whereas individual features of things were accidental. With the introduction of haecceity, Scotus introduces a model in which common essences coexist with
individual essences. This picture has come to be known as Scotistic realism.
 
In addition to Scotus, there is still one more Medieval European
philosopher who is worth mentioning for their treatment of the problem of
universals: William of Ockham. Ockham was born in England and educated at Oxford (though he never completed his degree in theology). Shortly after this,
Ockham published a theological commentary which landed him in some amount of
controversy. He was eventually called to Paris in order to defend himself in front of a
papal court. Because of this and other disputes, William fled to the royal court of Louis IV of Bavaria, who was already engaged in an open conflict with the church.
In exchange for patronage, Ockham wrote a treatise defending Louis’ right to rule
over the church within his territory. This treatise caused William to be
excommunicated, and he spent the remainder of his life writing on politics; eventually dying from the plague while still in Bavaria.
 
Like Abelard, Ockham is often remembered as a nominalist when it comes
to the problem of universals. However, there is some debate about whether he is
 
260 better considered a conceptualist. Conceptualism is the philosophical position that common essences have a real existence, but that they exist in the mind. The debate
between nominalism and conceptualism is, however, a subtle one. In some sense,
conceptualists are a kind of realist, as common essences are not just arbitrary linguistic conventions. However, their existence is only that of a concept.
Accordingly, there is a real difference between a duck and a Susamobile, but only a
conceptual difference. Certain concepts allow for universal knowledge (e.g.,
common essences) and others are only linguistic conventions.
 
More memorable still, than Ockham’s answer to the problem of universals,
is his work in epistemology. Here, we can think of Occam’s razor. Occam’s razor is a principle which tells us that simpler theories are more likely to be true. This idea is
also sometimes called ‘parsimony’, and simpler explanations are sometimes said to be
more ‘parsimonious’. To be sure, the razor does have some intuitive force. For instance, imagine that you walk out the door and see that the ground is wet. You
might think that this is because it rained. This is a simple explanation. By contrast,
you could also think that the ground is wet because it was both raining and because
your neighbor was watering the grass. The first explanation requires only that one thing is true whereas the second requires that two things are true. For this reason,
Ockham tells us that we should prefer the first, simpler explanation. In some cases,
this can make sense probabilistically, but in other cases it can be harder to defend.
For instance, consider the rotation of the planets around the sun. Astronomers preferred the heliocentric model (in which the planet revolve around the sun) over
the geocentric model (in which the sun and other planets revolve around the earth),
in part, because the first model has all of the planets going in simple circles, whereas
the second model involves the planets going in strange loops called ‘epicycles’. At
one level, this seems like a good idea; it does seem more likely that the planets just travel in circles than in complex loops, but why is that? Why should we assume that
nature is more likely to be simple than not? Interestingly, many physicists, when they
are pushed, will answer that the heliocentric model is more elegant. But notice that
this is an aesthetic feature about how beautiful an explanation is, not an epistemic feature about how rational the explanation is. Of course, we now have other reasons
to prefer the heliocentric model, but the question of why we should prefer the
simpler explanation to the more complex remains a philosophical problem. While
 
261
Ockham doesn’t provide us with a definitive answer (much like in the case of his exit
from Paris and his death), he can at least be credited with bringing the issue fully into
focus within epistemology.
 
Renaissance Feminist Philosophy 
 
With William of Ockham behind us, we can close our discussion of
Medieval philosophy. While we have already seen that there is some controversy
about when the Medieval period starts and ends, we can be sure that the intellectual environment in Europe was very different by the 15th and 16th centuries. In
northern Europe, the Protestant Reformation was in full swing. Scholars like Martin
Luther and John Calvin, both philosophers in their own right, had raised questions
about the legitimacy of the Catholic church and their lay followers began taking
theological problems into their own hands. Meanwhile, Italian advances in banking and finance led to a flourishing world of commerce and trade with other parts of the
world. This, in turn, meant greater investment into art and education. Scholars
financed by wealthy merchants turned further away from the accepted doctrines of
the church and towards ancient Greek ideas. While we have already seen that these two were not mutually exclusive during the Medieval period, the study of ancient
philosophy was typically done by clergy and in the context of church teachings.
Now, lay scholars were tackling philosophical questions directly. Where John Duns
Scotus was seen as a major intellectual figure before, being a follower of his became
synonymous with backwards thinking. In fact, this is where we derive the English word ‘dunce’ from. Mixed in among radical new theories about theology (in the case
of the Protestant Reformation) and advances in political and natural philosophy (in
the case of the Italian Renaissance) we also see a rise in women thinkers, who take the
problem of their social status head on.
 
First among these Renaissance feminist authors is Tullia d’Aragona. She was born into controversy among the noble houses of Rome. The exact identity of
her father is not known, but some speculate that it was a powerful Cardinal of the
time. If that wasn’t scandalous enough, the Cardinal in question was, himself, the
 
262 illegitimate grandson of the King of Naples, and his being the father of d’Aragona is
thought to have involved a coverup. Against the stigma associated with this story,
Tullia d’Aragona grew up as something of a child prodigy. By the time she reached
adulthood, she had established herself as a lady of the court in Rome and as a thinker and writer. She apparently had a profound impact on the men around her, as one
was reprimanded for telling her state secrets, one carved her name into every tree
along Po river, six formed a society together dedicated to protecting her honor, and
more than one is believed to have committed suicide over her. Beyond this, she was
briefly married for a time before her husband’s death, was tried on account of lavish spending and acquitted on account of her philosophical knowledge, and she opened
a philosophical academy in her house.
 
D’Aragona’s most famous work, Dialogues on the Infinity of Love, is notable
because it features a female protagonist (herself) expounding on the philosophical nature of love. The fact that we saw Diotima of Mantinea giving a philosophical
account of love in one of Plato’s dialogues as well is no coincidence. The work itself
is Neoplatonist and reflects a larger Neoplatonic revival sponsored during the time
period by the powerful Italian Medici family. D’Aragona is notable, among other things, because of her distinction between vulgar and virtuous love. Vulgar love is
characterized by the desire for the object of one’s affection. This involves taking up a
perspective in which the other person is an object to be consumed. Once this end has
been achieved, the desire is satisfied. By contrast, d’Aragona tells us that virtuous love involves wanting to fully unite oneself with the other. To view one’s romantic
partner in this way requires recognizing them as a person worthy of unification,
rather than as a commodity. Likewise, since the task of total unification with another
is an ideal we strive towards (and not actually achievable), it renders love infinite
rather than as a finite desire. We can call such an infinite desire (which is never fully
satiated) a drive.62 Despite her Platonic influences, Tullia d’Aragona does not view virtuous love as Platonic in the sense that we mean it today. In fact, she calls our attention back to the allegory of the charioteer. While many Neoplatonists idealize
Platonic love as a model, insofar as it represents a movement away from the physical
 
62 Drives will also form an important part of the theories of later philosophers like Friedrich Nietzsche. More can be read about Nietzsche in the “19th Century Continental Philosophy” chapter. 
 
263 desire of the earthly and towards the life of the mind, d’Aragona argues that a well-
functioning soul involves the rational part of the soul controlling one’s desires, not
eradicating them. Virtuous love is virtuous because it means that one’s physical
desires are reined in by a higher yearning, not because there are no physical desires. In this way, d’Aragona is strikingly progressive on the topic of sexuality in general (and
women’s sexuality in particular) given the background social views of Renaissance
Europe.
 
Another central figure in Italian Renaissance feminism is Moderata 
Fonte (born Modesta di Pozzo di Forzi). She was born in Venice to parents who died from the plague a year after her birth. She was then placed in the care of her
grandmother who had her educated at a convent at a young age. During this time,
Forte revealed herself to be a child prodigy as well, memorizing long sermons at the
convent, learning Latin from her grandfather, and taking up a number of musical instruments at the instruction of her brother. She eventually married and this
relationship was uncharacteristically loving for someone in her social position during
the time. As evidence of this, we have the fact that her husband returned her dowry
so that love remained the sole motivation for their continued marriage, and we also have her writings about his virtue. When Fonte died at the age of 37, while giving
birth to her fourth child and only a day after finishing her major works, her husband
installed a marble plaque on her tomb with an inscription which read “a very learned
woman”.
 
Fonte was accomplished as a playwright and a poet, but her most famous works were released only posthumously. These dialogues, titled The Merits of 
Women and The Worth of Women, depict a group of women discussing issues of
sexual ethics. The dialogues are notable for several reasons. First, while we have
already seen dialogues in which women provide philosophical theories and arguments, they have done so in conversation with men. Here, women discuss
philosophy amongst themselves. Second, while some of the philosophers we have so
far discussed attempt to justify the equal value of women, Fonte feels no such
explanatory burden. Rather, The Worth of Women focuses on the question of whether men are worthy of equal respect. Here, Fonte provides a guilty verdict, but
not without couching this verdict in the background Neoplatonism we also see in
d’Aragona. However, rather than arguing for an ideal form of love based in rational
 
264 governance over our desires, characters in Fonte’s dialogue worry that men place
themselves above women because of their (potentially natural) inability to put
reason about their appetites. Their appetites for what exactly? In this case, Fonte has
another character point out 1) that a dowry is paid by the bride’s family to the groom, and 2) that heiresses are commonly made subordinate to their brothers. This
is to say that men have a material interest in the subjugation of women, and that
their desire to advance themselves financially blinds them to their treatment of
women.
 
Rounding out our survey of the Italian Renaissance is Lucrezia 
Marinella. Much less is known about her than her contemporaries which we have already discussed. Like Moderata Fonte, she was born in Venice. Marinella’s father
was, himself, a well-known philosopher of the time and also wrote on issues affecting
women. Due to her abilities as a thinker and writer, she was influential in the formation of an important Venetian academy. In this role, she also worked to
promote and support the work of other women writers. Despite social pressure to
either marry or enter a convent, Marinella did marry until very late in life, and was
known for her secluded and learned lifestyle. This lifestyle allowed her time to publish on a wide range of topics, including gender, religion, science, and politics.
Yet, despite her early work arguing for and defending the value of women, she later
recanted some of these views and argued for women forgoing a literary life in favor of
a purely domestic role. However, this was less rooted in a total revaluation of her views about what women could excel at, and more to do with the hardships that
women face in the workplace. This marks a pessimistic turn in Marinella’s writing.
 
Marinella’s most famous work, The Nobility and Excellence of Women and 
the Defects and Vices of Men, is notable for her willingness to depart from some core
Neoplatonist ideas dominant at the time (especially among feminist authors). As we have already seen, Neoplatonists often eschew the physical for the mental in
reflection of Plato’s claim that the realm of forms is superior and more real than the
physical world of particulars. Accordingly, it was common for feminists to draw on
this to advance their own cause. If the soul is immaterial, and it resides in the realm of the forms before and after our physical lives, then it is not intrinsically tied to our
bodies. As a result, souls are a common universal form shared by all humans. This
means that the soul is not inherently gendered, and men and women are equally
 
265
capable of fulfilling rational lives.63 However, Marinella denies this claim. Instead,
she argues that men and women do differ in their natures, and this is actually the
reason why women are especially well-suited to govern. She points us to Aristotle’s
biological claims that differences in blood and body temperature affect the temperament of animals. Because of the lower temperature of women’s blood, they
are better able to regulate their desires. This, in turn, means a more developed
rational soul on Plato’s account and, as such, a better suitability for governance. This
argument is important for a couple of reasons. First, it further demonstrates the
productive work of synthesizing Aristotle and Neoplatonism in order to draw new conclusions (a trend we have already seen throughout the Medieval period). Second,
it places scientific knowledge and scientific education at the forefront of answering
political and social questions about the lives of women. This reflects a difference
between ‘essentialist’ and ‘non-essentialist’ theories of gender. While the larger
Neoplatonist model (gender non-essentialism) allows us to conclude very little about women’s essential nature (other than that they share with men in having a
common human soul), Marinella’s position (gender essentialism) tells us that
gender differences are ultimately rooted in biology.64 If this is right, then we would expect biology to tell us what makes women unique from men. This debate will
persist as a topic in feminist philosophy for some time.
 
Advances in feminist philosophy were not only made in Italy during this
time. Despite Italy’s centrality in European intellectual life, women philosophers across the continent were advancing arguments and engaging in philosophical
debates. This can be seen in, among others, the life and work of Marie de Gournay. Gournay was born in Paris and, like most of the thinkers we have
 
63 Notice the similarity between this argument and that, which we have already discussed, advanced by the Yoga practitioner Sulabhā in the Mahābhārata. 64 Importantly, gender essentialism is the position that gender identities are essential and immutable for individuals. While Marinella’s biology-based version (which we can call biological essentialism) is, perhaps, the most popular, gender essentialists need not think that biology settles the matter. For instance, one might think that humans have an immaterial soul, and this soul is essentially gendered. In fact, we encountered this claim early on, when Sulabhā argued against the idea, in addition to arguing against biological essentialism.  
 
266
discussed in this era, to a minor aristocratic family.65 She was quite accomplished as a
scholar starting at a young age; teaching herself Latin. However, her father, a
treasurer for King Henry III, died when Gournay was in her early teens, and this left
an opening for a father figure; a role filled by reading the works of the philosopher Michel de Montaigne. She eventually met Montaigne by happenstance in Paris and
became his unofficial adopted daughter. She published several commentaries on
Montaigne’s work and was ultimately left in charge of publishing his surviving
manuscripts when he passed away. This reputation allowed her to eventually secure
the patronage of the Queen of France and she went to work translating Roman works of history and poetry. This patronage allowed her to establish a reputation as a
classicist, poet, and commentator on women’s education.
 
Marie de Gournay’s moral philosophy is interesting, in part, because of the
centrality of honor within it. While many of the philosophers we have been discussing lean more towards Neoplatonism than Aristotelianism (a reflection of the
movement away from scholasticism at the time), Gournay defends the importance of
honor by appealing to Aristotle. Gournay argues that people engage in moral
behavior, sometimes, for immoral reasons. For instance, someone may give to charity only because they feel social pressure or in order to advance their reputation. For her,
this is a feature of honor. Honor is a way of regulating individual behavior through
social reputation, and it can motivate individuals to act in accordance with virtue
even when they otherwise lack a motivation to do so. This makes honor our most important social good. Given this importance, Gournay argues that revenge can be
justified in defending one’s reputation (a phenomenon common at the time and seen
in the practice of dueling). However, her focus on classical accounts of virtue also
enables her to justify the educational rights of women. As we have already seen, Plato
provides us with the metaphysical resources to assert women’s equality with men, but Gournay points out that the cultivation of virtue requires education and that the
 
65 Along with Gournay, we can add another important French feminist philosopher, Gabrielle Suchon. In addition to arguing for the equality of men and women, Suchon also advocated for secular celibacy (rather than monastic life or marriage) as a means of female empowerment.  
 
267 impediments to women’s advancement into positions of power deprive them of the
ability to lead flourishing lives of the kind that Aristotle advocated for.66
 
Finally, we arrive at the thought and works of Teresa of Ávila (born
Teresa Sánchez de Cepeda y Ahumada). As her name suggests, she was born in the
Spanish city of Ávila.67 Teresa’s father, a wool merchant, was one of the wealthiest people in the city, and was able to buy a knighthood despite his Jewish ancestry.
While Teresa’s grandfather had converted to Christianity forcibly during the
Spanish Inquisition, her family was devoutly Catholic by the time of her childhood.
The young Teresa’s religious conviction was apparently so intense that she ran away from home at the age of seven so that she could die as a martyr in the reconquest of
al-Andalus. Despite these efforts, an uncle was able to find her not far from town
and return her to her home. However, her religious fervor only deepened after the
death of her mother, and Teresa became a nun. During this time, she fought off bouts of illness by reading the works of Augustine of Hippo and by engaging in
religious mystical practices. Like Hildegard of Bingen, she began having visions and,
also like Hildegard of Bingen, she fought those above her in the church hierarchy in
order for her convent to be more secluded and more dedicated to poverty. The two women also share in their both being honored as saints within the Catholic church.
Further, while Hildegard lived prior to Teresa, it was Teresa who was named the first
woman Doctor of the Church.
 
While the Renaissance period thinkers we have so far discussed have all been
feminist philosophers in that they argued directly for the rights and value of women, Teresa’s status as a feminist thinker is more controversial. In one sense, by producing
philosophical work of value, her career stands as its own argument for the
intellectual equality of women. However, this work was less concerned with women
 
66 This is similar to Ban Zhao’s argument for the educational rights of women, which drew on Kongzi’s virtue ethics in contrast to Aristotle’s. It is also similar to the argument made by Anna Maria van Schurman (a Dutch contemporary of Gournay’s), that women should be educated in order to come to better knowledge of God. 
67 Teresa of Avila was not the only woman philosopher active in Spain around this time. Oliva Sabuco de Nantes Barrera (sometimes just referred to as Oliva Sabuco) is known to have defended mind-body dualism, virtue ethics, and the theory of macrocosm and microcosm. 
 
268 and their social role than it was with topics like metaphysics and epistemology.
Primarily, Teresa’s philosophical legacy is in her meditative practice. While earlier
philosophers (such as Augustine of Hippo) had written meditations, including those
on how we know what we know, Teresa does this in a way which sets the stage for modern philosophy. One difference is that Teresa frames the question of how we
know what we know in the context of radical doubt. When we are children, we go to school and learn a variety of facts. Then, as we get older, we use these facts to form
further beliefs. We are taught a particular model of our solar system and a particular
view about how physics works, Then, later, we accept that humans traveled to the moon on the basis of arguments that appeal to models which we were already taught.
The method of radical doubt asks us to set aside any belief which we have formed on
the basis of some earlier belief and to determine what can be known in and of itself.
If this process seems like merely reinventing the wheel, and reestablishing facts which we already know for no real reason, Teresa invites us to consider whether evil
demons could have deceived us and made us believe falsehoods. We think that we
occupy physical bodies, that we are present in our area of space at a particular time,
and that two plus two equals four. Yet, how can we be sure that these beliefs aren’t the result of the clever manipulation of all-powerful deceivers. The project, then, of
epistemology is one of coming to find some firm foundation for all of our
knowledge. Ultimately, Teresa’s response to this self-imposed doubt is that we can
secure our knowledge through God.68 This project, as we might expect of a religious mystic, is a Neoplatonic one. Teresa argues, on the basis of visions, that we can
develop ourselves away from physical desires and towards unification with God, and
she does so by imagining each stage of this process as a separate room we occupy in
our soul. She calls this model, and the text which describes it, The Interior Castle.
 
As we will see, the method of radical doubt will become the central concern of philosophy during the next period. However, before we can reach the early
 
68 The method of radical doubt is sometimes referred to as Cartesian doubt, because it was made popular by the Early Modern philosopher René Descartes. Indeed, like Teresa, he explores the issue in his own philosophical meditations, frames his worries in the context of a potential evil demon deceiver, and also appeals to God in order to get out of his skeptical situation. More can be read about his epistemological theories in the “René Descartes” chapter. 
 
269 modern period, the life and historical context of Teresa of Ávila raises, indirectly, an
important question. Teresa is writing and living in Spain during the time of
colonization. Accordingly, we might ask about the emergence of philosophy in what
the Spanish would refer to as ‘New Spain’. While, as we will see, colonization certainly introduced the European tradition of philosophy to the Americas, with its
central problems and figures, the indigenous peoples of the Americas had already,
long ago, developed their own systems of ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology.
This is precisely the topic towards which the next chapter turns.

Philosophy 
 
So far, our exploration of philosophy has assumed at least two things which
may not be true for philosophy everywhere in the world. The first of these is that
philosophy is done by individuals. The model for understanding philosophy which has been useful in examining developments in India, Greece, and China centers on
particular philosophers attributing ideas to other philosophers and responding to
each other through history. Of course, this sometimes takes the shape of
philosophical schools competing with other schools, but we can still point to sets of particular philosophers who make up those schools and to differences between
them. The second assumption which has guided us so far is that philosophy is
primarily a written enterprise or, at least, that we understand philosophers through a
written record. Writing things down allows future generations of philosophers to attribute and respond to ideas from particular historical figures. In this way, the two
assumptions support one another; the tendency to write things down makes it easier
for us to attribute authorship, and doing philosophy on an individual level makes it
easier to write things down and attribute that authorship. However, we need not
think that either assumption is always true.
 
This is the position, to some degree, that we find ourselves in while studying
the history of philosophy in Mesoamerica. To be clear, there is a surviving written
record of philosophy from the region prior to European contact, but it is limited.
Yet, the indigenous peoples of Mexico certainly still had and continue to have a way of looking at the world. This philosophical outlook is interesting to us in the same
way that ancient Greek, Indian, and Chinese philosophy is. It represents a way of
 
273 conceiving of human experience and the natural world which was not shown to be
wrong. The indigenous peoples of the Americas did not lose a philosophical debate,
and the philosophical tradition which originated in Greek Ionia did not come to
dominate the Americas because philosophers reasoned that it was a superior model for understanding the world. Rather, indigenous philosophies have been
marginalized within their own lands because of the disease, violence, and systematic
reeducation efforts which accompany colonialization. This leaves modern
philosophers in the position of adopting a variety of frameworks for researching
Mesoamerican thought prior to colonization. Principally this research has so far focused on the Maya and the Aztecs.
 
In terms of existing writing, there are, first, a number of ‘codices’ (or pre-
paper books) written by inhabitants of the civilization or sometimes written by those
from neighboring tribes. However, most of these codices date from around the time of colonization. This means that they could either 1) capture the views of these
civilizations after their being influenced by Spanish colonists, 2) represent the views
of neighboring tribes which aren’t shared by the civilization more generally, or (in
the case of the Maya) 3) not reflect the views of the people at the height of their civilization. Beyond these codices, there are also a number of monuments carved
with glyphs. Deciphering these glyphs can give us some insight into their builders’
religious and metaphysical beliefs, along with an idea of what they found valuable.
Finally, while they aren’t currently available to us, archeologists are aware that there were a number of other written documents prior to colonization. However, these
were often written on tree bark which did not hold up well in the humid climates of
Mesoamerica. Likewise, those which did survive the environmental conditions were
destroyed during the Spanish colonization. We can expect that philosophical and
religious texts were especially at risk of being destroyed by the Spanish given their interest in converting the native inhabitants to Christianity by force. This is all just
to say that there are a number of sources for indigenous philosophy in the Americas
(including writing), and that the gaps in the written record are as often or more often
the result of colonization than they are cultural differences in how history and ideas are passed down.
 
While the written record of indigenous Mesoamerican philosophy is not as
complete as we would hope, one way of supplementing it is to examine
 
274 anthropological evidence (such as cultural practices, art, and language) and to
discern what unified background philosophical framework could animate the beliefs
and practices we can attribute to the native peoples prior to colonization. This might
involve historical accounts from around the time of colonization or it might look at more isolated communities of indigenous peoples in the hopes that their way of
thinking has not been (or not significantly been) influenced by the culture and
philosophical beliefs of the colonizers. We can call this project ethnophilosophy.69 
However, this method is not without its pitfalls or its critics. For one thing, it puts
outside anthropologists in a position of authority in interpreting the beliefs of a people. We have seen throughout history that colonists often interpret the beliefs of
the colonized according to their political interests. For instance, if a colonist has an
economic interest in justifying the treatment of the colonized, then they may cast
those peoples’ beliefs in a light that makes them appear more ‘superstitious’, ‘exotic’, or ‘savage’ to their predominantly European audience. Likewise, even if those
colonists are acting in good faith in an attempt to actually understand the views of
the people that they are studying, they still might interpret those beliefs by analogy
with their own or those familiar to them (even when such an analogy is unhelpful). In the case of Mesoamerica, we see this reflected in Spanish colonizers interpreting
the Aztec religious beliefs by analogy with the Roman and Greek gods, despite this
analogy being deeply misleading.70 Finally, one can be skeptical of the entire project
of ethnophilosophy. If we want to understand the most sophisticated of ancient Greek thought, then we can study Democritus, Aristotle, Plato, and Cleanthes. Yet,
we don’t expect that the ideas of these thinkers will be reflected in the everyday
beliefs of ordinary Athenians (past or present). For one thing, regular people aren’t
philosophers and haven’t spent the time or energy necessary to hold elaborate views which adequately anticipate objections. Likewise, there is an enormous amount of
variation in the metaphysical and ethical beliefs of ancient Greeks. Aristotle and
Democritus disagree with one another; this means that ancient Greek philosophy
looks elaborate and varied in the written record. By contrast, the method of
 
69 Ethnophilosophy in general and its beginnings in the work of Placides Tempels (a Belgian missionary to the Congo) are discussed more fully in the “African Philosophy” chapter. 70 Modern scholars tend to interpret the various Aztec gods not as separate deities, but either as forces or aspects of a single unified god (in the same way that the various Hindu gods are aspects of Brahman). 
 
275 ethnophilosophy will necessarily be reductive. It will look at philosophical beliefs at
their level of commonality across the general population. Accordingly, we will find
less variation and less sophistication than we do in studying the writing of particular
authors and these views were likely outright rejected by a number of thinkers now lost to time. There is no reason to think that the intellectual history of indigenous
peoples isn’t as varied and sophisticated just because there is no written record of it.
This contrast will put cultures of writing on an unequal footing when compared to
cultures dominated by an oral tradition.
 
Worries such as these have led some scholars to adopt the framework of
professional philosophy.71 This movement seeks to instead focus only on the written work of individual philosophers (despite the philosophical written record not being as complete as we might like). Advocates of the professional philosophy
approach don’t necessarily believe that oral philosophical traditions aren’t actually philosophy, but that we should focus our efforts as scholars on where the written
record exists. Others, still, adopt the framework of sage philosophy.72 This
movement seeks to strike a balance between ethnophilosophy and professional
philosophy. Rather than focus on the language and practices of everyday people, sage philosophy involves those with philosophical training (in addition to or in place of
anthropological training) conducting interviews with individual sages. These sages
might be leaders, elders, healers, or spiritual advisors. The idea is that these
individuals are held in intellectual esteem by their communities in the same way that Greek, Indian, and Chinese philosophers are, and the interviewer can then
interrogate the sage in order to establish a written record where there was none.
Through this interrogation process, the sage will reveal their reasons for their beliefs
and counter arguments against them. This account can then be used as a foundation
for further inquiry by future scholars. However, there are limitations to both approaches. For instance, depending on the tradition, professional philosophy will
almost necessarily involve only including philosophers who have been educated in

‘western’ schools. Accordingly, professional philosophers (even those from
indigenous communities) are often influenced by and in conversation with thinkers
from other traditions. The merging together of two traditions (and the resulting
work) is a welcome contribution to philosophy, but if our project is one of understanding an independent indigenous tradition, then professional philosophy is
the furthest away from that goal of all of the frameworks we have discussed. By
contrast, sage philosophy comes closer. It allows for sophistication, variation, and
individual authors in a way that ethnophilosophy doesn’t, and it is less influenced by
other philosophical traditions than professional philosophy. However, it still leaves someone else (i.e., the interviewer) in a position of power in interpreting the
thoughts of the sage. Often, these interviewers will be from other philosophical
traditions, have political motivations that they may not be able to limit the influence
of, or still be susceptible to analogizing inappropriately. These worries can be mitigated when the interviewer is also from that community, but the same worries
persist, even if they are diminished. Likewise, sages who are active now are likely to
have been influenced by the religious and philosophical beliefs of their colonizers, no
matter how isolated their community might be. This is all just to say that those seeking to do philosophical scholarship in indigenous traditions have a variety of
tools and methodologies for doing research, and that all of these have their
advantages and disadvantages.
 
Here, we will discuss the picture that this scholarship has provided us with, along with the work of prominent professional philosophers from Mesoamerica in
the time before and after colonization. The first part of this exploration will focus on
the belief systems of two prominent peoples: the Maya and the Aztecs. While both of
these civilizations spent some time as the dominant force in Mesoamerica they were
centered in different regions and at different time periods. The Maya came to a position of power, as their name would suggest, in the Maya region of central
America (including the Yucatán Peninsula and Guatemalan Highlands).
Importantly, the Maya are not one group, but a collection of different peoples who
share a common language and some elements of a common culture. While there is evidence of inhabitants and developments within the region as far back as 2600
B.C.E., the Maya civilization reached its peak during what historians call the ‘classical
period’ (ranging from 250-900 C.E.). This would make the ideas we discuss in this
 
277







chapter contemporaneous with figures ranging from Iamblichus to al-Fārābī. 
However, just as we know that Indian philosophy emerged out of an older religious
context, we can assume that the Maya civilization inherited, to some degree, the
views and metaphysical framework of those who came before them. This is evidenced in commonalities between different peoples within the area. Importantly,
however, the Maya civilization began to collapse sometime in the 9th century for
reasons which are not entirely clear to historians. It was likely a result of a mixture of
political problems from warfare and environmental degradation due to
overpopulation. While the peoples that made up the Maya civilization persisted through to the modern day, their political, social, and intellectual dominance in
Mesoamerica waned. This collapse pushed the seat of power in the region
northward, where it could be inherited by the Aztec empire.
 
Like with the Maya, the Aztecs are not a single unified group. The peoples who made up the Aztec empire were predominately (but not exclusively) Nahua.
This refers to a group of peoples united by some cultural commonalities and their
speaking the Nahuatl language. These peoples include the Chalcans, Texcocans, and
others. Perhaps chief among these is the Mexica who, along with Tetzcoco and Tiacopan, formed the ‘Aztec Triple Alliance’. The resulting empire, which has come
to be called the Aztec empire, saw its political power centered in the Mexica city-state
of Tenochtitlan (in modern day Mexico City). Like many of the Nahua peoples, the
Mexica migrated from the north into the Valley of Mexico, though they were among the last to arrive (around 1200 C.E.). By 1345, the Mexica established themselves as
the dominant force within the new triple alliance, and their empire lasted until the
arrival of the Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés in 1521. Accordingly, this would
make the Aztec ideas we discuss contemporaneous with the work of figures like
Thomas Aquinas in Europe and Vidyāraṇya in India, through to Italian Renaissance thinkers like Lucrezia Marinella. However, as we will see, Nahuatl speaking
philosophers will continue to work through the Spanish colonization of the region.
 
278
Maya & Aztec Metaphysics  
 
As we might expect, Maya and Aztec philosophy is an enormous body of
beliefs about a wide range of topics. However, in terms of metaphysics, we see a
central preoccupation (in both cases) with change. For the Maya, this principally
concerns issues related to the metaphysics of time. A common view of time might be
that it is a natural procession of events which unfolds at a regular rate, and which began with the Big Bang. While we have invented some arbitrary increments (e.g.,
minutes, hours, weeks, etc.) in order to measure it, time itself has a stable reality
independent of our thoughts and actions; there was a time before us and there will
be a time after us. In addition, specific moments in time can be picked out according to their unique place within our dating system. Thursday, June 25th, 1908, is
different from Thursday, June 25th, 2076, because they fall on different dates. More
sophisticated readers might modify this picture by appealing to the theory of
relativity. In this case, something called ‘time dilation’ can occur. This means that moving clocks run slower than stationary clocks, and that clocks which are in close
proximity to objects with greater gravitational mass run slower than those that aren’t.
However, notice that these differences are still only affecting the rate of change from
individual moment to moment. Time, then, is often conceived of as an ever-extending ray composed of an infinite number of distinct moments. Regardless of
their local rate of progress, these events are fleeting, and they proceed in continuous
chain of subsequent events and in only one direction (toward the future). Likewise,
the structure of time is fixed in this way and beyond our control. Rather, any modifications to the playing out of time are only modifications in its apparent rate of
passing and are done only by dense physical bodies and the laws of physics. We can
call this view linear time.
 
In contrast to this picture, the Maya adopt a view known as cyclical time.
Rather than holding that time is a line composed of unique points, cyclical time conceives of time as following a set loop. On this account, when we cycle back
around to a previously visited point on the timeline (or, rather, time circle), we are
actually inhabiting the same moment, in some sense, as before. On a linear view, one
summer solstice and another are both said to take place in the same ‘springtime’ only in a nominal sense; these two distinct days, separated by a year, merely share some
 
279 meteorological and astronomical qualities. On a cyclical view, these two days are one
and the same; they cohabitate in the same ‘time-place’ on the circle. According to the
Maya, the Gods created humans for a very particular purpose: to keep time. In fact,
current humans only exist because of the failures of various earlier versions of humans to fulfill this function. Here, the Gods created the world and brought order
to it through the establishment of time. It is for this reason that we have the seasons,
the lunar cycles, and night and day. These, in turn, make life possible. The lunar
cycles control the tides, animals evolve to fill diurnal or nocturnal roles within their
ecosystem, and plants grow according to the seasons. The cyclical regimentation of time allows for the possibility of natural order. However, after the establishment of
this natural order, the Gods passed the job of preserving it off to humans.
Humanity’s role in nature is to maintain order by keeping time. In this way,
ceremonies which occur on a regular basis do not just celebrate or draw attention to these natural moments; they make them real. Where, in linear time, we might see an
event as celebrating or recognizing the end of summer, the Maya would hold that the
correct ritual actually ends summer, begins fall, and (on a larger scale) perpetuates
the continuity of time itself. Philosophers call the process, like this, of giving
something abstract a more concrete existence ‘reification’, and those that engage in it are said to ‘reify’ it. In this way, the Maya conception of time involves humans
reifying the cycles which provide order and structure to the world.
 
Through the process of reification, ritual and time are deeply connected. The days, the seasons, the years, and the ages are all made real by human action.
Spring is spring because humans engage in springtime behavior. This ritual
conformity brings together all springs and unites them under a common reality
which is distinct from summer, fall, and winter. Accordingly, if humans fail to fulfill
the proper ritual, or fail to engage in temporally appropriate behavior, then the seemingly natural passage of time could cease. That is, if humans do not treat
Autumn as Autumn, and harvest, there will cease to be an Autumn and there will
cease to be a harvest. Plants grow according to the order provided by the seasons, and
it is up to humans to preserve this order through ritual. In this way, the Maya view of time also opens up a normative dimension to how we spend it. While sociologists
sometimes use the word normative to refer to what is considered normal or what is
dominant, philosophers use the word to refer to how things truly ought to be. For
 
280 instance, morality is said to be normative because it tells us how we ought to behave,
even if no one actually agrees or actually behaves that way. Because humans are
charged with keeping time, and the order of the world depends on this, there are
better and worse ways to do this.
 
Linear and cyclical time 

 
linear  cyclical 

 
If the Maya hold that human ritual allows for the reality of natural phases,

the same can be said for the reality of an individual person. The Maya answer to the problem of personal identity does not hold that a particular human is a particular set
of atoms, a particular set of genes, or a particular set of memories, ideas, and
experiences. Rather, a person’s identity is fixed by their rituals in the same way that
moments are individuated by theirs. In this way, you are the rituals you engage in. You are the person that people can expect to be asleep in your bed in the morning, to
arrive at your workplace in your car at the normal time, and to visit your mom on the
weekends. Accordingly, you could become a different person by engaging in
different rituals. We see this in traditional Maya dance. Here, dancers engage in a
particular dance, dressed in a particular way, so as to take on the role of a particular god. However, these dancers do not merely stand in for the god or represent them;
they become them by fulfilling the rituals of the gods.
 
The centrality of change asserts itself differently for the Nahua people.
Many of the beliefs about the social construction of time which we find in the Maya are also found among the Nahua. However, access to more textual evidence allows us
to say a bit more about their metaphysical framework. Here, the Aztecs represent a
major departure from the metaphysical assumptions we have so far encountered.
 
281
The Presocratics attempted to answer the problem of the one and the many by
positing a number of different substances at the bottom of reality, be that water, air,
earth, fire, atoms, or being itself. Notice that these are things with fixed identities.
When Empedocles introduces forces (like love and hate), they are secondary phenomena meant to explain how new substances are combined and created. In this
way, processes tend to be thought of as emerging from and contingent on
substances. For instance, growing (as a process) is made possible by the plant that
grows. We can call this basic picture, which has been quite common, substance 
metaphysics.
 
Given this background assumption, change asserts itself as something in
need of explanation, where the fixed identity of substances is more readily taken on
as self-evident. While Heraclitus denied, in some ways, the persistence of identity in
favor of change, his philosophy was the exception rather than the rule. Despite Plato’s forms being immaterial, his theory of the forms still strongly assumes a
substance metaphysics. Remember that, for him, our knowledge is of universals and,
because those forms are eternal and unchanging, they are more real than the physical
particulars of our world. This is to say that Plato, and to a large degree Parmenides before him, puts Greek philosophy (and subsequent philosophy within the
tradition) on a track to think that what is permanent is more real and truer. In turn,
Aristotle and later Aristotelian attempt to identify the substances our speech points
to. By contrast, this entire model will be flipped on its head by the Aztecs. In place of
a substance metaphysics, they offer a process metaphysics. This model takes processes to be fundamental and substances to be emergent. Let’s see how they arrive
at that view.
 
In answer to the problem of the one and the many, the Aztecs posit teotl as
the principle of the universe. Teotl, like the dao in Daoism, is an ever-moving energy out of which the universe is built. Accordingly, Aztec metaphysics can be said to be
monist (as there is only one thing at the bottom of reality). However, while a
substance monism would have atoms combine to make molecules which can
support processes, the Aztec process monism posits teotl as a fundamental energy which supports the possibility of different processes. These, in turn, allow for the
emergence of substances. This makes the fundamental building block of the universe
dynamic, rather than a static substance, and the consequences of this view are quite
 
282 interesting. In this picture, the secondary processes which emerge out of teotl, and
make substances possible, are thought of as ‘polar unities’. Even Empedocles, with
his theory of fundamental forces, had thought of love and hate as two distinct and
opposite forces. By contrast, the Aztecs hold that teotl manifests as a variety of forces which are unified wholes composed of two opposing tendencies. In this way, we may
also be reminded of the Daoist yin and yang.
 
While the Aztecs discuss a number of these polar unities, we can take life
and death as a specific example. Rather than contrast life and death as independent
opposites, life and death form a single polar unity (life-death), which allows for the existence of beings. Notice the consequences of this reframing. If substances are
primary, then changes to those substances result in changes in the processes that they
support. Accordingly, we can imagine our own existence as fundamental and ask
how we could alter our existence so as to disallow the process of death. Death, in this case, is just a thing that we do and which we could, in principle, stop doing. By
contrast, the Aztec polar unity model means that 1) we can’t separate life from death,
and 2) life-death makes our existence possible. This model makes the question of
eradicating death a nonstarter; we are contingent on life-death rather than death being a distinct process which is contingent on us. Finally, polar unities work
according to the same cyclical patterns we have already seen. According to the Aztec
worldview, the two sides of life-death switch back and forth in the dominant role,
and this cycle continues ceaselessly.
 
Given the Aztecs’ process metaphysics, the problem of change is inverted. Rather than positing substances with fixed identities and seeking an explanation of
change, the Aztec worldview builds off of the assumption that polar unities are
processes which are constantly shifting. Accordingly, the search for truth and the
good life are cast against the backdrop of constant change. How, in a world of churning cycles of forces which support and compete with one another, can we have
stable knowledge and happiness? While Plato would happily endorse this question
and answer that we must shift our attention towards the more perfect and eternal
realm of the forms, the Aztec answer is that we must seek a path in this world. There is no other world to appeal to to arbitrate our doubts or to give us lasting and perfect
insight. This metaphysical framework, in turn, will inform Aztec epistemology and
ethical philosophy.
 
283
Maya & Aztec Epistemology 
 
Understanding Maya epistemology requires first familiarizing ourselves with
two concepts: ch’ul and itz. Itz, for the Maya, is a kind of vital force which pervades all of existence. However, unlike the Aztec teotl, the Maya do not hold that
everything is composed of itz. Rather, each thing is brought together and unified as a
distinct thing by its itz. In this way, it is not dissimilar from John Duns Scotus’ concept of haecceity (differing mainly in its dynamic nature as opposed to Scotus’
substance metaphysics). As we might expect, itz (as an essential and defining force) is
central to Maya accounts of truth and knowledge. We have already seen that many
philosophers around the world have held that genuine knowledge about x is a matter of coming to know the essence of x. Accordingly, we might expect that genuine
knowledge, for the Maya, is a matter of coming to access a thing’s itz. This is not
wrong, but it is slightly more complicated than this. First, while it is sometimes
described, by analogy, as the ‘sap of the universe’, itz is a force and not a substance. As such, coming to knowledge of it will not be a matter of knowing its defining
characteristics in the way that we would expect for a substance. We can see this in the
modern understanding of gravity. Scientists tell us that gravity is a force and, as a
result, we don’t spend too much time asking what gravity is. An account of what gravity is is exhausted, instead, by describing how it works. Likewise, knowledge of a
thing’s itz is a matter of seeing its operations. Seeing how itz works in a thing, and
how the itz of different things are connected and interact will give us the fullest
understanding available to us.
 
However, the fundamentally dynamic nature of the world does not offer us stable knowledge. Accordingly, wisdom is not a matter of collecting permanent
knowledge about the essences of things or the fixed laws which govern them.
Instead, being able to see the itz requires maintaining a relationship with those
things. Just because you saw the underlying relationship between the itz of one thing and the itz of another in a way that reveals their connectedness, that does not mean
that the relationship is still true in exactly the same way. As we might expect,
establishing and maintaining this relationship is a matter of engaging in the
appropriate ritual practice. The itz of humans, which the Maya call ch’ul, allows us to enter into a dynamical relationship with itz more generally. It is for this reason
 
284 that sages are able to access wisdom which is not available to those who do not
engage in ritual practice. Likewise, where knowledge that might be transmitted from
the sage and then be the possession of their student, knowing how things are moving
requires revisiting the ritual or establishing one’s own connection to the itz.
 
The epistemological implications of this process-oriented picture are further elaborated by the Aztecs. As we have already seen, the metaphysical framework of
the Nahua peoples renders the search for a permanent and unchanging truth a fool's
errand. In turn, this encourages Aztec philosophy away from being ‘truth-seeking’
(in a search for knowledge that) and towards being ‘way-seeking’ (in a search for knowledge how). This means that wisdom amounts to finding, through experience,
a way to navigate our lives in the world. Accordingly, we should expect wisdom-
loving philosophers from the Aztec world to be those with considerable lived
experience, and that is exactly what we find. The Nahuatl word ‘tlamatini’ (roughly meaning ‘someone who knows something’) can be understood as a close
equivalent to the English word ‘philosopher’. However, the expectation that
tlamatinime would have practical knowledge afforded to them by experience means
that the concept includes a bit more. Tlamatinime were warriors and rulers who established themselves and then turned to raising and answering philosophical
questions, and the writings that survive to us from them are primarily in the form of
poetry. We have already seen philosophers writing poetry, as far back as Xenophanes
and as recently as Marie de Gournay, however the poetic form is essential for the Aztec philosophical practice. This can be seen in one of the most famous poetic
dialogues in the Nahua canon, the “Dialogue on Flower and Song” from the
Cantares Mexicanos codex, which details the events of a philosophical gathering
initiated by the tlamatini Tecayehautzin of Huexotzinco prior to the colonization
of the region.
 
Tecayehautzin called together as many well respected tlamatini as he could
to discuss the value of poetry (or ‘flowersong’), and the dialogue gives us some
insight into the different thoughts of each attendee. While the conversation is
ostensibly on an aesthetic question, we see that aesthetics, ethics, and epistemology are all substantially tied together in the Aztec worldview. It makes sense that a way-
seeking tradition would center questions about the good life in the pursuit of
wisdom. After all, what is the ultimate judge of one’s claims to knowledge if it
 
285 doesn’t manifest in the fruits of their life. However, poetry is deeply interwoven into
this project. During the dialogue, Cuauhentenzcotli laments that the world is fundamentally unstable and constantly changing, and this threatens to render truth
and value meaningless. Our efforts at leaving a legacy will all wash away, along with our riches and our health. Likewise, anything beautiful we create in the world will
ultimately be destroyed. For Cuauhentenzcotli, this also threatens the truth and
reality of humans. If what is real is what is true (in the Platonic sense) and
permanent, and nothing is permanent, then nothing is real or true. Though
Cuauhentenzcotli offers this as a lament, we can formalize it as an argument below:
 
1.   Something is valuable, real, or true if and only if it is lasting.
2.   Nothing is lasting.
3.   Therefore, nothing is valuable, real, or true.
 
Cuauhentenzcotli’s lament is a worry about nihilism. We have already encountered moral nihilism in the Ājīvika school of classical Indian philosophy, but
Cuauhentenzcotli’s nihilism is global. In addition to doubting the reality of an
objective morality, he also doubts the possibility of objective truth, aesthetic value,
and objective reality for humans. This sets those who come after him in the dialogue on a course for discussing truth, value, and reality in the context of Aztec
metaphysics. While the various responses given by the tlamatinime give us an
opportunity to understand Aztec aesthetics and ethical theory, Aquiauhtzin
addresses the epistemological worry. Recall that the ultimate nature of reality, for the
Aztecs, is teotl. In Aztec religious practice, teotl is cast as the supreme god Ometeotl (in much the same way that Brahman is both the ultimate substance of all of reality
and the supreme god of Hinduism). For Aquiauhtzin, poetry not only presents us
with the only way of describing Ometeotl, but also actually brings Ometeotl forth
through its symbolic representation. Thus, where negative theology tells us that we can only describe God by saying what he is not, Aquiauhtzin’s view tells us that we
can only describe God poetically. This account serves two functions. First, it is an
aesthetic theory which explains the value of flowersong in its bringing forth of
Ometeotl. Second, it is an epistemic theory which explains that we can arrive at the true and real nature of reality (teotl) only through poetry.
 
286
Maya & Aztec Ethical Philosophy 
 
The Maya conception of moral life is distinctive for a few reasons which are
interrelated. First, we find, at its heart, the importance of balance. We have already
seen, with Aristotle’s doctrine of the mean, that balance can play an essential role in
moral theorizing. However, the Maya think of balance in a different way than
Aristotle. His view was meant to provide us with an account of what virtue is, and he takes it morality is about cultivating a virtuous character. The Maya see balance as
valuable for its own sake, and valuable across a range of organizational levels. First,
there is balance within an individual, which is achieved through a life of moderation.
This is roughly in keeping with Aristotle’s doctrine of the mean. However, there is also balance within a community, between communities, and within an ecosystem.
Individuals ought to strive to maintain or restore the balance at every level. Where
Aristotle’s account would ultimately need to explain our obligations to the
ecosystem in terms of individual virtue, the Maya account sees balance as an intrinsic good wherever it can be found.
 
The second good which is defining for Maya moral life is respect. In this
case, two parties to a morally salient interaction are expected to recognize one
another and to show humility. In turn, if one were to fail to show adequate respect in one’s interactions, the community is thrown out of balance. The solution, then, is
not punishment, but a restoration of balance. A popular theory of justice tells us that
justice is about giving a person the treatment that they deserve; a person who
commits a bad act deserves something bad to happen to them and a person who does
a good thing deserves something good to happen for them. This position can be
called retributivism.73 By contrast, the classical Maya endorse a form of restorative justice. On this model, justice is ultimately about restoring the relationship between the injured and the injuring parties. Punishment, on this
account, will not restore balance; that requires that an offender recognize and respect the victim in the way that they were initially respected themselves.
 
73 Retributivism was famously defended by the modern philosopher Immanuel Kant. More can be read about him, his ethical theory generally, and his theory of justice in the “Immanuel Kant” chapter. 
 
287
Balance also asserts itself as central to the Maya conception of distributive
justice as well. Here, we might expect the balance-focused Maya to endorse
egalitarianism, or the position that all people are equal and, as such, deserve equal
access to resources. After all, what could be more balanced than everyone having exactly the same amount of wealth. However, balance, in the domain of Maya
distributive justice, takes the shape of a polar unity. Just as the Aztec saw life and
death as a single phenomenon defined by the push and pull between the two
tendencies, the Maya see distributive justice in terms of a cycle. Contrary to
egalitarianism, individuals are allowed to accumulate some significant wealth. However, this is just one period of domination in a cycle which must persist.
Accordingly, wealthy individuals are expected to restore balance to the system, and
to recognize that the other side of the cycle must also have its day. Typically, this
involves a redistributive ‘fiesta’, in which the wealthy purchase and gift their way out of wealth and thereby put resources back into the community. This reflects the
dynamical and cyclical nature of the Maya worldview. Where ‘Western’ philosophy
might expect one permanent and universal arrangement for the optimally just social
situation, the Maya expect that what is just is indexed to a particular situation in time; one that will behave according to a cycle.
 
The Aztecs inherit this basic picture and expand on it in a number of ways.
They share with the Maya the focus on balance and on moderation. The dynamic
nature of reality is often described in terms of a slippery or muddy earth. The challenge, for the tlamatinime, is in finding a path through the mud, and to pass it
along to those around them. We have already seen than the sages of Mesoamerica
have a particular insight, through their use of ritual, and the same is true for moral
understanding. Moral education, for the Aztecs, is the sole dominion of the
tlamatinime. However, this still leaves room for considerable disagreement about the
goods of life. For instance, we see, in Nezahualcóyotl (born Acolmiztli), a renewed focus on traditional moral values and on the centrality of god.
 
Nezahualcóyotl was born as the prince of Texcoco. However, he was forced
into exile after his father was assassinated by the neighboring city-state of Azcapotzalco. After an extended period in hiding in the forest, earning the nickname
'hungry coyote’, Nezahualcóyotl was allowed to enter the Mexica city-state of
Tenochtitlan, where his mother’s sister was king. There, he was heavily influenced by
 
288
Mexica culture and set to work planning the restoration of Texcoco and his return to
power. In this effort, he pioneered the establishment of the Aztec Triple alliance
(between Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan). Back in power, Nezahualcóyotl
quickly began to institute legal reforms and undertook a series of construction projects. With regards to the latter, he established himself as an engineer of renown.
He personally designed a number of monuments and aqueducts and established a
massive library and public gathering place for intellectuals. In terms of his legal
reforms, recall the tlamatini’s dual role as a moral teacher and ruler. Nezahualcóyotl’s
vision of moral cultivation is part Kongzi (in his belief that rulers instill virtue) and part Shang Yang (in his belief that laws should be fairly and harshly enforced). Many
of these were conservative in their nature (governing sex and alcohol), and they were
harshly and fairly enforced. Nezahualcóyotl saw that the law was applied to nobles as
well as commoners, and he even went as far as to execute 4 of his estimated 110 children for sexual impropriety. These moral strictures should be understood in
terms of Nezahualcóyotl’s religious beliefs, which were seen as idiosyncratic at the
time. While some attribute him with an aversion to sacrificial practices and belief in a
new singular god, others argue that this might be a later story told by the Texcocans to differentiate themselves from the Mexica in the eyes of their Spanish colonizers.
However, the written record from around the time of his life at least tell us that he
saw God as a being who created himself, and that the good life was one in which a
person pursued knowledge of God through poetry, even if ultimate knowledge would evade them.
 
In contrast to this view, we have a number of other tlamatinime, who offer
competing accounts of the good life.74 In the “Dialogue on Flower and Song”,
Ayocuan Cuetzpaltzin endorses the happiness that friendship brings as a
foundation for value and meaning in life. While, as Cuauhentenzcotli tells us, nothing is lasting in this life, Ayocuan Cuetzpaltzin argues that happiness is valuable
enough in the present moment to warrant its cultivation and need not be rooted in
 
74 While there were women tlamatini, but few of their names and little of their writing survives to this time. For instance, Macuilxochitl’s “Song of Macuilxochitl” remains, but it is a historical account of political events, not a philosophical work. As such, we are unable to know what their accounts of the good life were, or how those theories differed from those of their male counterparts.  
 
289 anything more permanent. Monencauhtzin, by contrast, endorses the pursuit of the aesthetic pleasure of poetry as providing us with the key to a valuable and
meaningful life. Both of these views, with their emphasis on simple and fleeting
pleasures, resemble Epicureanism to some degree. Thus, while Aquiauhtzin, Nezahualcóyotl, and Monencauhtzin all see poetry as essential to the good life, they
have different reasons for it. Aquiauhtzin is optimistic that poetry can tap into
something more real, permanent, and true than our everyday experience, and is
valuable for that reason, Nezahualcóyotl is less optimistic. Genuine knowledge of
God is evasive, but the pursuit of that knowledge through poetry still makes life worth living. Finally, for Monencauhtzin flowersong is valuable simply because of its
aesthetic value. However, despite these differences, all of these thinkers still reflect
the greater tendency of the tlamatinime to draw together philosophy and poetry as
essential to the good life.
 
Juana Inés de la Cruz 
 
Within a hundred years of the conversation depicted in the “Dialogue on
Flowers and Song”, the Spanish had established a foothold in Mexico. With colonization, the Spanish also brought their philosophical tradition to Mexico.
While this was primarily at the expense of indigenous philosophy, the tlamatini we
have so far discussed would not be the last ‘knowers of things’ among the indigenous
population, nor would they be the last philosophers to write in Nahuatl. One major
example of this is found in Juana Inés de la Cruz (born Doña Inés de Asbaje y Ramírez de Santillana and sometimes referred to simply as Sor Juana). She was born
in San Miguel Nepantla (in the modern state of Mexico) in 1648 C.E., to Spanish-
born parents. Sor Juana was born out of wedlock and never knew her father, but her
mother’s independent wealth allowed her to have a relatively stable and privileged life. Staying at her grandfather’s large estate, she spent much of her time learning in
his vast library. By the age of three she had taught herself to read and write in Latin
and, by her early teens, she was proficient in accounting, ancient Greek philosophy,
and the Nahuatl language as well (composing works in it). Ultimately, however, this love of learning was curtailed when, at the age of 16, she was denied permission from
 
290 her mother to dress as a boy in order to attend college. Despite this, she continued to
write and read as a lady of the court until she was forced (as women often were at the
time) to choose between getting married or becoming a nun. Having already turned
down several offers of marriage, she chose the latter, as it would give her sufficient time to continue her studies.
 
Her first attempt at religious living involved joining the Order of Discalded
Carmelites; the same group which was founded by Teresa of Ávila. However, unlike
Teresa, who began the order because she found the Carmelites too relaxed, Sor Juana
spent only a few months with the group before switching to the more easy-going Order of Saint Jerome. In this role, she converted her cell into a library and parlor
where she continued writing, studying, and seeing intellectual visitors. During this
time, she took on a patronage from the Viceroy of New Spain, which allowed her to
publish prolifically, writing plays, poems, and essays in Spanish and Nahuatl.  Ultimately, her period of productivity was put to an end when a bishop published a
criticism she wrote of church hierarchy without her consent. The bishop published
it along with a commentary in which he pretended to be a fellow nun and criticized
Juana for not being sufficiently devout and for spending too much time engaged in secular writing. In turn, Sor Juana responded by publishing a response to this ‘nun’,
in which she argued for the education of women and for women’s role in intellectual
life. Here, she quoted Teresa of Ávila by saying that “one can perfectly well
philosophize while cooking supper.”75 However, this dispute eventually led to her being reprimanded by church authorities. In order to avoid an official censure, she
agreed to pay a penance. She signed this agreement in her own blood and (perhaps
sarcastically) by writing “I, the worst of all women”.76 Her enormous library, then
consisting of around 4,000 works, was dismantled and sold, and she died shortly
after while attending to other nuns who had fallen sick. Only a small fraction of her written work survives to this day, but it spans a number of languages and literary
forms. In addition to this, she is also featured on the Mexican 200-peso bill (an

291 honor she shares with fellow philosopher Nezahualcóyotl, who was depicted on the
100-peso bill). She was called the ‘Tenth Muse’, the ‘Phoenix of America’, and she is
sometimes referred to now as the first feminist in the Americas.
 
In terms of Juana’s philosophical contributions, her background self-
education in Latin and Greek should give us some insight. As we saw in our discussion of Medieval philosophy and Renaissance Italy, Neoplatonism and
scholastic Aristotelianism were the dominant philosophical ideas within European
philosophy at the time of her life. We see both influences in her own work as well. In
her philosophical poem, “First Dream”, she described the separation of the soul from the body during a dream, and the soul’s ascent through a hierarchy of being and
knowledge (much like that described in earlier Neoplatonic works). In this journey,
the soul attempts to achieve universal knowledge but is quickly overwhelmed. It
then tries to structure its learning in accordance with Aristotle’s categories, but the poem does not make clear whether this project will actually lead to the universal
knowledge the soul craves. The open-endedness of this poem, along with some of her
other works, paints the picture of a skeptical philosopher.77 While it assumes a
Platonic framework (at least rhetorically) in which the soul is distinct from the body and seeks universal knowledge, she is not convinced that Plato’s ambition is satisfied
by Aristotle’s system and, in turn, scholasticism. This thread is addressed again in the
poem “Let Us Pretend I am Happy”. Interestingly, here, she seems to conclude that
skepticism can only be overcome through poetry rather than philosophical reasoning. This is strikingly similar, as we have already seen, to the positions of
Nezahualcóyotl and Aquiauhtzin. In this way, Sor Juana’s position appears like an
application of earlier Aztec thought to the European philosophical tradition, a
reflection of her own historical situation. This reading is further supported by her
‘philosophical-moral sonnets’. In these, she imagines a beautiful rose in a field and discusses its inevitable decay and death before inserting herself as a character to
 
77 It remains an open question in the scholarship whether Sor Juana was influenced by the philosopher Rene Descartes, who was a contemporary of hers. Descartes also discusses the distinction between body and soul, the philosophical implications of dreams, and raises skeptical concerns about knowledge. This work would have been available to her at the time that she wrote “First Dream”, but whether or not she had read it and was consciously referencing it is unknown to us. More can be read about Descartes in the “Rene Descartes” chapter. 
 
292 advise the rose to enjoy its beauty while it still possesses it. In addition to the fact that
this is a philosophical poem (the standard form for Nahua tlamatini), and its focus
on the decay of flowers (a common topic in Nahua philosophy), Sor Juana’s answer
to the flower’s predicament is also very much in line with the moral theorizing of earlier Aztec thinkers. For instance, Ayocuan Cuetzpaltzin had already taken a
similarly Epicurean line in endorsing the pleasures of life as the ultimate good. The
inevitability of beauty’s decline does not make it less valuable, or mean that we
should value something else instead, but actually gives further reason to enjoy the
pleasures of the here and now.
 
To be clear, Sor Juana does not explicitly state whether and how her
philosophical outlook was shaped by Nahua philosophers. Likewise, the Cantares 
Mexicanos codex was not fully translated into Spanish until the late 20th century.
However, Sor Juana would not need to read it in Spanish, as she was proficient in the Nahuatl language from a young age and wrote some of her work in it. Likewise, we
also see, in some of her plays, a more sympathetic picture of the indigenous
inhabitants of Mexico. The Divine Narcissus depicts Aztec religious belief as less
‘savage’ than contemporary accounts and offers a humane depiction of native resistance to Catholic conversion. In the end, the play concludes that the Spanish
Catholics and the Nahua worship the same god, and points towards similarities
between the Catholic understanding of the Eucharist and Aztec ritual sacrifice. This
suggests that she had at least some intellectual respect for the beliefs of Mexico’s indigenous peoples. In this way, Sor Juana’s philosophy (whether intentional or
otherwise) serves as a bridge connecting earlier Mesoamerican philosophy to the
newly imported traditions of scholasticism and Neoplatonism.
 
Yet, Mesoamerica is not alone in having a long history of indigenous
philosophy which now draws the attention of scholars of ethnophilosophy, sage philosophy, and professional philosophy. Indeed, these terms and methodologies
actually emerged in thinking about philosophy in another part of the world. It is to
there, Africa, that we turn our attention next.

Key Questions 
 
1. If an imposter were to pretend to be you, taking over all of the tasks 
of your life, living in your house, dressing in your clothes, and
spending time with your friends and family as you, is there still a
sense in which you are the ‘real’ you? Why or why not?
 
2. Are there aspects of reality/life that can’t be explained in prose, as 
Aquiauhtzin claims? If no, why not? If yes, then provide an example
and explain how it could be captured (through, poetry, music,
experience, etc.).
 
3. Would you rather live in an egalitarian society (in which everyone 
has the same amount of resources and opportunities), a non-
egalitarian society (in which some have much more than others, or a
society like the classical Maya (which is non-egalitarian, but everyone
spends some time at both the top and bottom of society)? Why?
 
4. Which tlamatini provides the best answer to the question of how to 
live a good life? Why?
 
5. Is being concerned with beauty (including our own) irrational? Why 
or why not?
 
295
African 
 
Philosophy 
 
As we might expect, philosophy in Africa goes back a very long time.
Humans emerged as a species in Africa, and we have every reason to think
philosophy emerged, as a practice, there as well. It is likely that human theorizing and arguing about the nature of the world and our relationship to it long predates our
written record of it, and it has likely been with us for almost all of our existence.
However, Africa’s early contributions to philosophy are also reflected in the written
record as well. For instance, the ancient Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten is said to have departed from the dominant religion of his society and, instead, mandated the
worship of the sun (or ‘Aten’) as the one true god. The Great Hymn to the Aten,
describes Akhenaten’s religious beliefs and, in doing so, tells us that he saw solar
energy as the answer to the problem of the one and the many. According to this view, solar energy is the underlying principle of all things, and from it all other
elements are made. This hymn predates the life and death of Thales by roughly 700
years and puts Akhenaten in line with the earliest estimations of the lifetime of
Zoroaster (that is, 30 years prior to Saggil-kīnam-ubbib). Accordingly, Akhenaten is
beaten out only by Enheduanna as the earliest known philosopher. Likewise, as we have already seen, ancient Egypt’s contributions to philosophy were not isolated in
time and space. After all, Pythagoras was known to have traveled to Egypt in order to
study mathematics and this, in turn, influenced the development of Pythagoreanism
and eventually Platonism.
 
In the same way, northern Africa has also already asserted itself as an
important site of philosophy from the time of the Presocratics through to the
 
297 
Middle Ages. For instance, the Cyrenaics took their name from the town in Libya in
which their three founding members (Aristippus of Cyrene, Arete of Cyrene, and
Aristippus the Younger) were born and lived. A similar story can be told about later
skeptics like Carneades (also from Cyrene) and Sextus Empiricus (from Alexandria in Egypt), and about Neoplatonists like Plotinus (from Lyopolis in Egypt) and
Hypatia (from Alexandria). In addition, there were also several Christian thinkers
from Africa during late antiquity and the Medieval period, like John Philoponus
(from Alexandria) and Augustine of Hippo (from Thagaste in modern-day Algeria).
Finally, while they were not born there, both Ibn Ṭufayl and Ibn Rushd spend a good amount of their lives working and writing in Morocco. Of course, many of
these philosophers were, or were descended from, Greek or Arab colonists to
northern Africa, others were not. For instance, Augustine of Hippo was a member
of the native Berber community. However, besides those figures already covered elsewhere, Africa can also claim its own Socrates-like figure in the Nigerian Yoruba
 
philosopher Ọrúnmìlà. Like Socrates, Ọrúnmìlà spent much of his time as a ̀ ̀ skeptic; challenging those who claimed to have knowledge and demonstrating that
they did not. Also like Socrates, he believed in the theory of reincarnation, the power of divination, and in the importance of virtue. However, unlike Plato’s Socrates,
̀ Ọrúnmìlà defended a participatory form of government.78 In addition, Ọrúnmìlà is  ̀
thought to have lived in the ancient Nigerian city of Ilé-Ifẹ̀ around the time of, but
actually prior to, Socrates’ life in Athens.
 
Beyond these figures, there is also a sizable body of indigenous philosophy
in Africa. In fact, the terms and methodologies we have already used to discuss
indigenous Mesoamerican philosophy originate with scholarship in and about
African philosophy. The first work studying indigenous philosophy is often said to
be Placides Tempels’ Bantu Philosophy. Tempels was a Belgian missionary to the Congo who attempted to reconstruct the beliefs of the native population in order to
assist later missionaries in converting them to Christianity. By better understanding
what colonized peoples actually think, Tempels thought that he could better answer
 
philosopher Sophie Olúwọlé, in her book Socrates and Ọrúnmìlà: Two Patron Saints of ̀ Classical Philosophy 78 The most thorough account of Ọrúnmìlà’s teachings to date is offered by the Nigerian ̀ (2015). She is also known for, among other things, elaborating on and defending his theory of reincarnation. 
 
298 their theological questions and argue for the truth of Christianity. His focus was on
the Bantu people of the Congo and his work analyzed their practices and language in
order to determine the underlying philosophical framework common to those in the
community. For this reason, Bantu Philosophy is often thought of as the first work of ethnophilosophy. Yet, as we have already seen, ethnophilosophy is not without its
critics or its criticisms. While Tempels believed himself to have an interest in
accuracy, his work was still the product of a European colonist who ultimately
wished to disprove the Bantu’s belief system. This means that Tempels also had a
motive to render the beliefs in a way that Christianity could respond to, along with the biases which come with the project of colonialism. However, as we will see, the
general methodological approach would also be taken up by native African
philosophers as well and applied to a number of indigenous groups. Yet, just as
ethnophilosophy arises in the study of African beliefs, so too do its alternatives. The professional philosophy movement, which argued for restricting our study to the
written record of experts, was founded by the Beninese philosopher Paulin J. 
Hountondji. In the same way, the sage philosophy movement, which sought to
interview respected elders, leaders, and intellectual outsiders in order to establish a written record of their beliefs and their reasons for believing them, was started by the
Kenyan philosopher Henry Odera Oruka.
 
The following sections will provide an account of the results of all three of
these inquiries (ethnophilosophy, professional philosophy, and sage philosophy) with regards to a number of different communities (the Yoruba, Igbo, and Akan in
West Africa and the Bantu peoples of Central and Southern Africa). Likewise, these
sections will cover indigenous and professional philosophy in metaphysics (with
regards to existence, time, and the self), epistemology, and ethics. Finally, the last
section of this chapter will also discuss the epistemological work of two Ethiopian philosophers which will set the stage for the rest of our inquiry into Early Modern
philosophy.
 
African Metaphysics 
 
As mentioned above, the field of ethnophilosophy was pioneered by the
work of Placides Tempels in his book Bantu Philosophy. Accordingly, this makes
 
299
Bantu philosophy a good place to start our study of philosophy in Africa. Here,
Tempels’ central claim in the book is a metaphysical one. He tells us that the Bantu
conception of being is a process metaphysics rather than a substance metaphysics;
the Bantu posit vital force as the ultimate building block of being. This makes Bantu metaphysics dynamical in nature like that of the Aztecs and Daoists, rather than
unchanging and rigid like most of ‘western’ metaphysics. However, we still might
want to know more about what vital force consists in, and how this picture can
inform our interactions with the world and with each other. First, we are told that
vital force can come in degrees. That is, different kinds of things exist to differing degrees. This stands in contrast to substance metaphysics, which tells us either 1)
that things either exist or they don't, or 2) if some things have more existence than
others then they have a different kind of existence (e.g., material or immaterial).
However, one object's degree of being isn’t set entirely by the kind of thing it is. Instead, different people might have different degrees of being and their being may
be increased or diminished through their interactions with the vital force of other
beings. Accordingly, it is in our interest to secure and promote our being. Elders are
put in charge because they have more being than younger people, and they have more being because they are able to draw on the vital force of their family. This also
explains differences between seemingly like things in the world. Temples draws on
the example of hunting boars. In one case, an arrow will hit a boar and kill it
instantly, however a similarly sized boar might take up to ten arrows without being killed. While we might expect, from the outside, the two creatures to have equivalent
strength and vitality, one’s ability to outlast the other is explained by its having more
vital force than the other. As a result, obtaining and maintaining more vital force
translates into great health, will-power, and influence.
 
This basic picture has a certain logic to it. If to exist is just to have certain powers, to affect things around you, then having more of this power is to have more
existence and is better all things considered. Yet, perhaps there is still more which can
be said about vital forces. The Rwandan philosopher Alexis Kagamé argues that
there are four different fundamental kinds of forces within Bantu metaphysics: 1) muntu, 2) kintu, 3) hantu, and 4) kuntu. First, muntu (or human force) describes
human beings. What sets us apart from the rest of the vital forces at work in the
world, for Kagamé, is that we are intelligent. However, humans are not alone in this.
 
300
Rather, Kagamé tells us that the living and the dead both have muntu, along with all
of the gods and lesser spirits. Presumably, children have less muntu than adults (as
they are generally less intelligent), and the gods have more than humans. Thus, where
Tempels could tell us that there is a hierarchy of being based on the accumulation of vital force, Kagamé can tell us what, exactly, this means in the case of muntu. By
contrast, kintu refers to those beings which must be set into motion by muntu. Our
intelligence as beings of muntu allows us to act for reasons. However, trees, animals,
and rocks lack this intelligence and thus can’t decide to act in the world. Luckily for
them, the muntu of the spirit realm can initiate their motion for them. This is to say that, ultimately, the gods and spirits are responsible for setting the natural world into
motion and for providing some governing logic to drive their motions. Third, we
have hantu, or the force of time and space. This force acts to bind muntu and kintu
beings to a particular location and point in time. Finally, there are modalities, or kuntu. The kuntu is set apart from other fundamental forces because they cannot be
described and can only be experienced. Accordingly, we can think of things like
beauty and humor as forms of kuntu. Despite their indescribability, things like
beauty are still forces because they can still influence events in the world. For instance, the beauty of a particular song might move you to dance or to ask someone
out on a date and, in that way, they must have some level of existence. Kagamé tells
us that their existence is that of kuntu.
Kagamé’s four categories of vital force 
 
Meaning  Defining Feature  Example 
 
Muntu Human Force  It is Intelligent  People, Spirits, Gods 
Kintu The Force of Things  It Must be Acted on  Plants, Animals, Rocks 
Hantu The Force of Time & Space  It Binds to Time & Space  Time, Space 
 
Kuntu Modality  It is Experienced  Beauty, Humor 
Beyond being, additional ethnophilosophical work in Bantu philosophy has
also been done on the concept of time. Most of this work builds off of or responds to
that of the Kenyan philosopher John Mbiti. Mbiti analyzed the Kikamba and Gikuyu languages popular among the Bantu peoples of Kenya and concluded that
there was a distinctly African conception of time. On his account, the Bantu
 
301 conception of time is not exactly linear in the way that we have previously discussed,
but it is also not cyclical. On a common view, time is a linear sequence of instances
which events slot into. While we may not know what will happen on Sunday,
November 30th, 2031, we can talk about it and plan around it in the same way that we can talk about dates in the past. That is, it exists in precisely the same way that
April 26th, 1889, exists. This picture renders time like a beaded necklace; while new
events are added, one after the other, they are arranged on some underlying
substance that we call time. By contrast, according to Mbiti, the Bantu deny that
there is such a substance underlying events. Rather, there are only events. Notice, however, that the past has well-defined events, which have had a real impact on the
events that came after them, and all the way up until now. However, the same can’t
be said for future events which are not imminently about to happen. We plan now
for the harvest that will come shortly, but we do not plan for the indeterminate and unknown events of November 30th, 2031. Thus, if having some force and influence
in the world has been our benchmark for existence so far, then far future events seem
not to have any real existence. Accordingly, the slogan used to describe Mbiti’s view
is that there is “a long past, a present, and virtually no future.”79 
 
While the account of Bantu philosophy that we have so far sketched is an
interesting and seemingly systematic one, it may not be as representative as scholars
would hope. Here, one of ethnophilosophy’s most influential critics, the Ugandan
scholar and poet Okot p’Bitek, raised a number of criticisms about all of the work we have discussed. For one thing, much of the early work in ethnophilosophy was
oversold. That is, rather than asserting a small and local claim about a particular
community, many ethnophilosophers claimed that their accounts were of African
philosophy generally. However, Africa is, in many ways, the seat of human existence.
The fact that humans have lived continuously on the continent since the beginning of our species has meant that African culture has had ample time to diversify. For
instance, there are almost 2,000 languages spoken on the continent. Why should we
think that what is true of the Bantu peoples will be true of all of Africa? The same
problem arises even within the case of the Bantu. The Bantu consist of around 400 different ethnic groups and speak around 500 different languages. While all of these
 
79 John Mbiti, African Religions and Philosophy (New York City: Doubleday, 1970): 21. 
 
302 languages are Bantu languages, that does not necessarily mean that they all share the
same conception of time or being. After all, Aristotle and Plato didn’t share the same
conception of being and they both spoke Attic Greek.
 
This last point gestures as p’Bitek’s larger criticism of early
ethnophilosophy. Ethnophilosophy holds that cultures can be the bearers of philosophical doctrines. Mbiti, Kagamé, and Tempels make claims about the
philosophical positions of Africans or the Bantu in general. Meanwhile, not only do
we recognize considerable disagreement among the ancient Greeks about matters of
philosophy, but we can also point to individuals and show where those individuals actually claim these doctrines. By contrast, the ethnophilosopher analyzes linguistic
and cultural practices and takes themselves to be revealing what underlies them.
However, this means that no individual Bantu person may believe the things that
these scholars attribute to them. In what sense can we say that these views are representative of African or Bantu philosophy if no individual Africans or Bantu
people consciously endorse the doctrines which are attributed to the group as a
whole?
 
Where does all of this leave us? Despite their disagreements, the debate
between the ethnophilosophers and their critics was a productive one. In this way,
the Ghanaian philosopher Kwasi Wiredu took a synthetic approach in doing African philosophy. While the critics are right that Plato and Aristotle disagreed with
not only each other, but with the predominant and accepted views of their time, the
common views of their society framed their thought. Thales is often counted as the first Greek philosopher because his way of explaining the natural world departed
from the kinds of explanations which were common at the time. In the same way,
Wiredu argues that careful ethnophilosophical work can serve as an African
foundation for later professional philosophers to respond to, criticize, and further develop.
 
One such thinker is the Nigerian philosopher Innocent Asouzu. Asouzu is
the founder of the conversational school (a subset of the Calabar school), which
developed a system of metaphysics and epistemology which takes broader African philosophical commitments as a starting point, but which isn’t merely describing a
commonly held folk view. Instead, Asouzu endorses the view he describes; thinking
 
303 that it builds off of African intuitions about metaphysics but is, itself, a refined
philosophical system. On Asouzu’s view, we should see beings not as substances in
the traditional sense or as forces, but as ‘missing links’. Substance metaphysics tells us
that there are discrete and independent substances in the world, such as atoms and chickens. The different natures of these things can be understood independently
and, often, it is helpful to understand one thing by first understanding the parts
which make it up. If we want to understand what a dog is, we should break it down
into its parts (systems, organs, tissues, cells, organelles), which have an independent
nature which can be understood to us. Likewise, once we understand these parts independently, we can understand the dog as a result of its parts. The resulting
picture also means that we can know what dogs are without needing to know about
cats or trees.
 
Asouzu’s account of beings as missing links alters this picture substantially. First, Asouzu tells us that things are not independent, just as links of a chain are not
independent. Rather, we can only understand the nature of one link by
understanding its relational role in a web of interlocking chains. This means that
there is, for instance, nothing that it is to be a dog independent of how dogs fit into the complex web of things in the world; we can’t understand substances in isolation
from one another. However, the metaphor also tells us more. Things could be
related to one another in virtue of their opposition. For example, we can’t
understand a chess player’s performance in a game without understanding how it relates to the performance of their opponent. While the natures of these two
phenomena are related, they are opposed to one another. A murderer and their
victim are related to one another in a certain way, but they do not support each
other. By contrast, links in a chain do support one another. Since this account
applies to humans in the same way that it applies to all things, it means that humans stand in a complimentary and supporting relationship with one another and with
the rest of the natural world. Accordingly, knowing our own true nature will entail
knowing the ways in which we are not self-sufficient, and in which others rely on us.
Thus, Asouzu’s theory of being, called ibuanyidanda (or ‘complimentary reflection’), has ethical and epistemological implications in addition to metaphysical
ones.
 
304
African Personhood 
 
As we have seen, Asouzu’s theory of ibuanyidanda derives some ethical
implications from a metaphysics of being. If all things are missing links, then humans
are missing links as well. This means that we can only really understand our own
nature as part of a larger system in which we rely on others, and they rely on us. This
picture tells us two things that will help to guide us as we continue to explore issues in African philosophy. First, this story shows us that the metaphysics of personhood
can serve as a link from being as such to moral philosophy. This has already been true
in much of the philosophical work we have encountered (whether in ancient Greece
or Mesoamerica), and the same is true in African philosophy. Personhood comes with some moral obligations. We expect people to do the right thing and to follow
the law in a way that we don’t expect crocodiles or tornados to. Accordingly, we
punish, reward, praise, and blame humans insofar as they are persons. On the other
hand, personhood also secures us certain rights. Being a fully developed person often means that you are able to vote, engage in certain kinds of behaviors not permitted of
minors, and that you have the authority to determine the course of your own life. As
such, a lot rides on whether or not a creature is counted as a person. Yet, it is clearly
more complicated than just saying that all and only humans are persons. As we have already seen, children are often not regarded as full persons in the eyes of the law.
Likewise, some legal scholars have argued that great apes ought to qualify as persons
legally.80 It is one thing to ask whether the law in any given jurisdiction counts a
creature as a person, but the philosophical problem of personhood is the question of what the law should be or, rather, what conditions must be met in order for
something to count as a person.
 
The other reason Asouzu’s theory is telling is that it is, on the one hand, his
own contribution to philosophy and, on the other, grounded in the background
conceptualization of being which he takes to be an African idea. If he is right about this, then we might expect that other African accounts of personhood will share
something in common with Asouzu’s account. In this case, we do find that Asouzu’s
 
80 Stephen M. Wise, Rattling the Cage: Toward Legal Rights for Animals (Cambridge: Perseus, 2000). 
 
305 idea that personhood is a social phenomenon is common among African theories of
personhood, even if different philosophers disagree about how best to express that
conceptually. This has two implications. First, it means that it might make little or
no sense to think of a person alone on a desert island. Of course, there is still a human being on that island, but the question of their being a person simply doesn’t arise
because there is no one for them to be related to. Such a view might strike us as
strange, but it is also intuitive as well. For instance, if personhood is all about when
we have obligations to others and when others must respect our rights, then there is
simply no point in raising the question alone on an island. The second implication is that personhood, on many of the accounts we will discuss, is a matter of degree. We
might think that a creature either is or is not a person, and that there is some
metaphysical fact of the matter based on their capacity for reason, emotion,
language, or some combination of them. However, if personhood can come in degrees, then we might be able to accumulate personhood in our lifetime or lose it.
Indeed, we might be able to be more or less of a person than another person. While
this, too, might sound a little counterintuitive, there is at least some precedent for
thinking along these lines. For example, children are persons in the sense that secures them many rights that nonhuman animals do not have, but they are not persons in
the sense that adults are. For instance, a nine-year-old doesn’t have the right to buy
cigarettes, but a twenty-nine-year-old does. In this way, if personhood is tied up with
having corresponding rights, then legal systems often regard different humans as having different degrees of personhood. The trouble is, then, figuring out where
exactly to draw this line in a morally responsible way.
 
One of the most famous African accounts of personhood is found in the
concept of Ubuntu (the Nguni Bantu word for ‘humanity’). The concept was
popularized by the Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu through his fight against apartheid and his search for peace and reconciliation in its aftermath, and it is often
summed up with the Zulu phrase ‘a person is a person through other persons.’ As
Tutu showed, and we will discuss when addressing African ethical philosophy, the
moral implications of this view can be quite profound. We should notice the similarity between the Ubuntu account of personhood and that given by Asouzu.
The Ubuntu conception of the person is also fundamentally relational; there can be
no person in isolation from others. Similar sentiments are expressed by John Mbiti,
 
306
when he famously wrote that “I am because we are.”81 How, though, do we go about
acquiring our personhood through other people? The answer to this question is a
matter of controversy.
 
One view has come to be called the morality model of personhood.
According to this theory, we cultivate personhood by, at all times, manifesting our concern for the interests of others. This view is defended by the Kenyan American
philosopher D.A. Masolo. For Masolo, a person’s actions encourage us to rely on
one another and someone is more fully a person to the degree that they do that.
Accordingly, when you engage in antisocial behavior, you work against the obligations that others have toward you. To illustrate how this might make sense,
consider an incredibly wealthy person who passes by a homeless man without any
consideration. The wealthy person might think that they have independent lives;
they fail to recognize the extent to which we all rely on one another and imagine that each person is and ought to be entirely self-sufficient. Indeed, this might be true, to a
limited extent, for the wealthy person. They think they are self-sufficient because
they can buy whatever they need. However, they are not actually fully independent.
For instance, they can’t be self-sufficient when it comes to having friends or relationships, and unless they dedicate themselves fully to constant work, they
probably rely on others in order to secure food and shelter. Yet, by acting in a way
that fails to recognize our interdependence, this person closes themselves off from
their responsibilities to others; they act as if they are living alone on a desert island. The morality model tells us that this behavior diminishes their personhood. The
human that actually lives alone on the island has no need for thinking or talking
about moral obligations or rights. The person who walls themselves off from their
community imagines, erroneously, that they live this way. As a result, they reduce
their own humanity.
 
We can contrast the morality model of personhood with the uniqueness model of personhood proposed by the South African philosopher Mpho 
Tshivhase. She raises a number of problems for Masolo’s theory, but our concern
will be with one in particular, the problem of the moral saint. Here, a moral saint is a
 
81 Mbiti, African Religions and Philosophy: 152. 
 
307
person who always does their moral duty.82 For example, Mother Teresa dedicated
her entire life to helping those most in need even when it meant taking on enormous
sacrifices on her own part. Tshivhase points out that if being a person is all about
manifesting our regard for others and encouraging our interdependence, then we should expect that moral saints have achieved the highest level of personhood
possible. Yet, we might think that Mother Teresa's life is entirely too selfless. A moral
saint always puts the needs of others above themselves and, since there are always
needy people, that means never actually getting to act according to their own desires.
On this view, moral saints like Mother Teresa are literally self-less. Cultivating oneself is a matter of developing your own skills, interests, and passions, and the
moral saint has not done that. For Tshivhase, the morality model of personhood
suffers as an explanation of personhood because it tells us that fully becoming a
person requires giving up on ourselves and cultivating our own interests. In its place, she defends the uniqueness model. According to her, we are persons to the extent
that we are authentic and autonomous. This is to say that a complete person will 1)
discover themselves, realizing their own interests (authenticity) and 2) work towards
the ability to realize those interests in a self-sufficient way (autonomy). These two components, for Tshivhase, contribute to the development of a unique self, and
being a unique self is the essence of personhood. If we worry that this could lead us
back towards the antisocial behavior of the wealthy person in the example above,
Tshivhase has a response. Here, she tells us that the ideal of interdependence and common concern still has a place in ethics, even if not in matters of personhood.
Likewise, people in our communities might be better able to rely on one another and
assist one when they are able to realize their own interests and potentials.
 
As we have already seen and will continue to see, African philosophy is not a
monolith. In this way, Tshivhase is not alone in criticizing some communal conceptions of personhood as not fully recognizing our individuality. Another critic,
the Ghanaian philosopher Kwame Gyekye, raised similar concerns about the Akan
idea of a person. Here, Kwasi Wiredu had argued (along similar lines as Masolo), for
a communal account of what it is to be a person. According to Wiredu, personhood can, both, come in degrees and must be achieved. In response, Gyekye argues that
 
82 This concept of the ‘moral saint’ originates with the American philosopher Susan Wolf (Wolf 1982).   
 
308 such a view fails to recognize the actual equality of all people. If one earns their
personhood by participating in and promoting communal life, then that means that
outsiders to a community are not fully persons. Yet, Gyekye points out, we still think
they do and ought to be afforded all of the same rights that we extend to members of our community. For Gyekye, personhood is the result of the basic level of rationality
which all humans have and, therefore, personhood does not come in degrees.
 
Wiredu’s response to Gyekye is to develop the two-tiered theory of 
personhood. On this view, there is a kind of personhood which all humans have,
and which guarantees certain rights and there is another kind of personhood which serves as an ideal of realizing oneself fully through communal life. In this case, being
a human is sufficient to be a person in the first sense (and thus have rights), but being
a human is necessary but not sufficient to be a person in the second sense (and thus
be a complete moral agent). This account should be relatively intuitive to us. For instance, as we have already discussed, children are seen as having human rights, but
they are not seen as punishable or blameworthy in a full sense. This tells us that
having moral obligations and having moral rights do not necessarily go hand in hand.
Further, this second sense of personhood, in which someone becomes fully morally responsible, can come in degrees where the first can’t. However, Wiredu points to
another example in arguing that this conception is actually the one commonly held
by the Akan people. On his account, the Akan believe in the theory of selective 
reincarnation. While we have already seen other cultures and philosophers hold that people are born, live, and die in a cycle of rebirth (reincarnation), the Akan
differ in that they hold that this process only happens to some people. In this case,
persons in the first sense (humans deserving of human rights) who fail to realize their
potential as persons in the second sense may be given a second chance at doing so.
For example, a well-behaved child who never makes it to adulthood is otherwise deserving of a second chance at becoming a full person and may be reincarnated.
Meanwhile, someone who lived into old age and achieved full personhood does not
need this opportunity, and an adult who acted in antisocial ways does not deserve it.
Thus, according to Wiredu, the Akan concept of the person is two-tiered.
 
Yet, metaphysical and religious beliefs can tell us more about African
conceptions of personhood than merely that they tend to view personhood as
communal, earned, and coming in degrees. One of the more interesting findings, for
 
309 our purposes, concerns Ndau people of Zimbabwe. Like many traditional societies
and religions, they believe it is possible for one person to become possessed with the
spirit of another. However, this takes on a particular shape within their belief system.
We might, on the face of it, think that belief in the possibility of possession is highly correlated with dualism. If it is possible for one person’s mind or spirit to inhabit and
control the body of another person, then the mind and body seem to at least be
substantively distinct. However, the Ndau view of possession goes further. On their
account, rather than the person coming to be possessed late in life and for a short
time only, people can be born tied to the spirit of a deceased person. As we might expect, the deceased can take control of the body in a way that possessions normally
involve. However, the long-lasting and ongoing link between the spirit and the
possessed also impacts that person's sense of self. They are not merely two drivers
competing to steer the body; the possessed person’s identity is tied up with the personality, interests, habits, and temperament of the spirit which inhabits them.
This means that there is not a clear distinction between possessed and the possessor.
We can contrast this with a standard dualist picture in which the two spirits of
individuals have their own discrete existence apart from one another.
 
African Value Theory 
 
With a broad understanding of African ideas of metaphysics and
personhood in hand, we can now turn to the topic of African ethical theorizing. We
have already seen that African conceptions of being and personhood tend to be (but
are not always) relational; these views commonly see things and people as necessarily and importantly interconnected. It is no surprise then, that this has corresponding
implications for how we ought to live amongst one another. It was said that the
South African Anglican Bishop Desmond Tutu drew on the concept of Ubuntu in
his civil rights work during Apartheid. What, then, are the ethical implications of the Ubuntu view that ‘a person is a person through other persons’? The South African
philosopher Mogobe Ramose has taken up Tutu’s tentative definition and popularization of Ubuntu and attempted to fill in the philosophical details. Recall
 
310 that this view means that people become fully human or fully persons through
mutual recognition with others. This has two implications for Ramose and Tutu,
both of which are framed in the context of Apartheid but apply more broadly. First,
when black South Africans live under Apartheid, they are dehumanized. Because they are not permitted to be fully engaged in civic and social life, they are not allowed
to fully realize their potential or live meaningfully within a social group. This should
strike us as relatively straightforward. We often say that repressive and racist regimes
engage in dehumanization in an overt sense, through propaganda and policies which
treat one social group as less than fully human. However, Ubuntu allows us to understand the underlying metaphysics involved in this process.
 
On the other hand, Ubuntu philosophy also says more. In this case, not
only are the victims of Apartheid dehumanized, so are the oppressors. Recall that
achieving a complete degree of humanity requires the mutual recognition that one lives among other persons. The colonists of South Africa did not recognize their own
interdependence with the victims of their policies and, as such, reduced their own
humanity. This is reflected in the fact that cruel people, like those who participate in
or tolerate such regimes, are said to be ‘inhuman’. Within Ubuntu philosophy, this statement is literally and metaphysically true. This, in turn, has an interesting
implication. Often, addressing human rights issues requires appealing to the interests
and rights of the victim. When someone mistreats someone, we remind them that
their victim is entitled to certain rights. They are, after all, human. However, to the oppressor, they would simply deny their victim's humanity. How do we convince a
person who is involved in dehumanization that they are doing so when they think
that they are rightly treating a nonhuman as they really are.83 Ubuntu ethics has now
given us a new way of addressing this problem on the perpetrators’ own terms. They
are clearly not interested in the humanity of their victim, but they are, presumably, interested in their own. Even the most evil and selfish person will want to realize and
preserve their own humanity, even if they fail to recognize that of others. Yet,
 
83 The question of how we might motivate an otherwise rational person to behave morality is also famously taken up by the modern philosopher Immanuel Kant. More can be read about his answer to this problem in the “Immanuel Kant” chapter. 
 
311
Ubuntu tells us that recognizing the humanity of others is necessary even to achieve
this selfish end.
 
While it is clear that the Ubuntu idea of personhood has significant ethical
implications, it is not as clear what it looks like as a systematic theory of moral
philosophy. Accordingly, there have been multiple different attempts to provide a fuller account of Ubuntu ethics. One proposal for how to think about Ubuntu
ethics comes from the Zimbabwean philosopher Fainos Mangena. Mangena
argues that Ubuntu ethical decision-making flows through a common moral 
position (CMP). Plato and Aristotle argued that the individual person is the most fundamental unit in moral action. For Plato, the good life consists in our fulfilling
our own particular function in society, and the highest goal towards which we can
aim is grasping the form of the good (a task left to each person). Likewise, Aristotle
argued that morality is ultimately about cultivating virtue within ourselves as rational animals. Aristotelian ethics focuses on the individual fulfilling their
potential. Beyond this, where we have so far encountered other theories (such as
Mozi’s state consequentialism and Peter Abelard and Héloïse d'Argenteuil’s
deontological theory), the question of what the right thing to do is is still ultimately left up to the individual to decide, even if they ought to be sensitive to the rights or
well-being of those around them. We can contrast this with ethics done from the
common moral position. According to this theory, rather than us determining what
our moral obligation is, we have a moral obligation with regards to how we determine our obligations. The community represents the common moral position
because the community is the judge of what behaviors, decisions, attitudes, and
policies are appropriate or not. Individualistic models of moral decision-making have
us, as individuals, determine the correct course of action and take responsibility for
the choices we make. By contrast, the common moral position tells us that communities exercise agency. Individuals ought to take their concerns and dilemmas
to the group so that the group can decide, and this process leaves the group
accountable for results of this decision. In this way, personhood is communal
because communities are the primary moral agents in the world, making decisions and taking responsibility for them.
 
However, as stated above, this is not the only interpretation of communal
ethics. Indeed, other scholars have found and endorsed ways of capturing the
 
312 communal nature of Ubuntu ethics from the individual moral position that is more
common to philosophy. One prominent example of this is the work of the
American-born South African philosopher Thaddeus Metz. Metz defends what he
calls the ‘relational theory’ of ethics. On this interpretation, Ubuntu is best thought of as social cohesion consequentialism. With Mozi, we have already seen
some consequentialist theories of ethics. These tell us that morality is ultimately
about choosing the actions and policies which produce the best consequences. Of
course, there is considerable disagreement about what kind of consequences matter.
For instance, we might think, as Mozi does, that actions are good to the degree that they promote increased populations, material wealth, and order. On the other hand,
we might think that morality is just about doing whatever produces the greatest
amount of well-being for the greatest number of people. While these theories differ
in which consequences matter, they both hold that it is consequences that matter. Meanwhile, we can contrast this with deontological theories (like that of Peter
Abelard and Héloïse d'Argenteuil). They argue that it is our intentions that matter.
It doesn’t matter if we do good if our reasons for doing it were wrong (such as giving
to charity accidentally or so that we can get a tax write-off). Likewise, it doesn’t matter if we mess up and accidentally make things worse, as long as we mean to do
the right thing. Metz’ relational theory is consequentialist, so it is closer to Mozi’s
than it is to Abelard and d'Argenteuil’s. However, Metz argues that an action is good
to the extent that it maximizes social harmony and minimizes social discord. This is the sense in which it is communal. Thus, rather than giving communities the final
say in moral decision-making, Metz’ theory still keeps individual humans as the
primary moral agents, but they are to act in the interest of community building and
community preservation. This means that, for any given decision, we ought to choose the action that will most bring people together.
 
This story also has a profound implication for justice as well, and one which
has been somewhat controversial. As we mentioned already, Bishop Desmond Tutu
was a prominent popularizer of the concept of Ubuntu, and he was also central to
the end of Apartheid in South Africa. In the time immediately after Apartheid, Tutu was chair of the ‘Truth and Reconciliation’ commission. This commission sought to
promote reconciliation and forgiveness among the policy’s victims and perpetrators.
In addition to investigating the causes and victims in need of reparations, the
 
313 commission also attempted to have perpetrators confess to their unjust behavior and
have victims forgive them.84 In order to achieve this goal, the commission granted
immunity from prosecution to those that fully admitted to their role in human
rights abuses. This policy was controversial because many people think that human rights abuses are unforgivable or that, at the very least, forgiving someone who
committed such horrible crimes to you and your family is going well above-and-
beyond what is morally expected of us. However, Metz’ account of relational ethics
captures the moral intuitions behind Tutu’s Ubuntu approach to truth and
reconciliation. For one thing, forgiveness (when paired with confession and genuine remorse on the side of the perpetrator) is what would best contribute to social
cohesion. What is most important, after all, is bringing members of the community
together, rather than further dividing them. Beyond this, however, is the fact that
consequentialist theories, more generally, lack supererogation.85 Here, supererogation refers to going morally above-and-beyond. If we are morally
obligated to maximize social cohesion, then we must always do whatever course of
action does that. Maximization means doing the best thing as often as we can. This
means that the bar for being a moral person is, for any consequentialist theory, set fairly high. This gives Metz’ theory of Ubuntu the force to explain why victims of
Apartheid ought to forgive their oppressors. However, if we think that the concept
of going above-and-beyond morally is worth preserving, then this fact may count as a
reason against consequentialism in general and Metz’ relational theory of ethics in particular.
 
Finally, as we might expect, the communalist nature of much of African
ethical and metaphysical theory also manifests in African political philosophy. This
should be no surprise, as we have already seen that Desmond Tutu drew policy
implications from Ubuntu ethical theory. However, communalism may also provide us with an account of the structure of the state as well. Kwasi Wiredu drew on the
political process of the Asante people of Ghana in order to defend a consensus
driven model of politics. Before explaining what, exactly, this entails however, we
 
84 This model is a form of restorative justice, which we have already encountered in the “Mesoamerican Philosophy” chapter. 
85 Kwame Gyekye has also written on the issue of supererogation in African ethical theory more generally.  
 
314 should recall the nature of the democratic system that has come to dominate much
of the world. The democratic view has a wide array of different people with different
individual interests vote and the dominant position is pursued as the approved
course of action. In a representative democracy, this involves voting for politicians who, in turn, vote on policy. In a direct democracy, this involves the general
population of citizens voting directly on policy themselves. While voting schemes
differ, they all share in one feature common of democracies: some people will not get
the policy outcome that they prefer. By contrast, consensus building means only
pursuing those policies or politicians which everyone supports. Of course, this will still involve a good amount of compromise; those at the political extremes are
unlikely to get what they want. However, this avoids a situation in which two
extremely opposed groups fight for control, one narrowly wins a vote, and then
passes policies which 49% of people actively hate. However, beyond tending towards moderation, consensus also serves a goal that Mangena and Metz would likely
endorse, community harmony through group agency. In a democratic model, parties
are pitted against one another; one side wins and another loses. The result of this is
that only one group of people are responsible for the decision-making. Accordingly, the losing side can deny responsibility for the results of what the winning party does.
By contrast, everyone is implicated in a consensus decision. The community as a
whole is responsible for the outcome and every individual person contributed to that
decision. The question that remains, however, is how to achieve this kind of consensus in large societies. Wiredu, after all, draws on the traditional politics of the
Asante, who live in comparatively small groups. By contrast, the political scientist is
left to determine how we get to universal agreement in countries claiming millions of
inhabitants. Here, Wiredu defends a more workable alternative. Instead of a direct consensus, we still have individuals vote on elected representatives (according to a
democratic model). However, those representatives are required to achieve
consensus rather than win a narrow majority.
 
315
Zera Yacob & Walda Heywat 
 
Our discussion of metaphysics centered on the Akan of Ghana and the
Bantu of South and Central Africa. Meanwhile, our account of African value theory
focused primarily on South African Ubuntu philosophy and Akan political
philosophy. However, with the topic of epistemology, we now turn to Ethiopia.
This turn also reflects a return to our overall timeline. Ethnophilosophy aims to represent the views of traditional African communities which can often trace their
identities and beliefs back before the written record. Yet, it is professional
philosophers in the 20th and 21st century that work out the theoretical implications
of these accounts. In Ethiopia, we return to the 17th century in order to resume our journey through the history of ideas. In this case, we focus our attention on the
philosopher Zera Yacob and his student Walda Heywat. Yacob was born in town of
Aksum, in the northern Ethiopian Tigray Province. He was raised in an Ethiopian
Orthodox Christian farming family and received a religious education in this regard. When, under the emperor Susenyos, Yacob criticized the now dominant Roman
Catholicism, he was forced to flee with only a small amount of gold and some
religious texts. While traveling south, Yacob took up residence in a cave along the
Tekezé River. There, he spent the next two years in isolation. It was there that he meditated and developed his philosophical theories. When Susenyos died, and his
Ethiopian Orthodox son took over, Zera Yacob came out of isolation and settled in
the northern town of Emfraz. Here he sought and found a patron and began a
family. He also took up instruction of his patron’s two sons. What written work we have that survives of Yacob’s (a single treatise called the Hatata, or ‘inquiry’) was
produced during this time at the request of one of these sons (Walda Heywat).
Beyond this, little else is known about Yacob’s philosophical views or about his life,
other than that he is believed to have died sometime in his nineties.
 
With regards to his philosophical views, Yacob is most defined by his insistence on scrutinizing his beliefs. Yacob does not simply adopt the religious
doctrines that were dominant at his time or rely on the authority of common sense.
Rather, reason is and ought to be the ultimate judge of truth, and we should work to
review all of our beliefs in the light of reason. We can call this philosophical position
 
316
rationalism.86 However, it is not enough to say that we should scrutinize our beliefs rationally, because we must have some rational method for doing so. In this regard, Yacob is guided by three basic assumptions: 1) that God exists, 2) that God is
good, and 3) that God created the world in the way that is on the basis of his goodness. With these three building blocks, however, Yacob is able to derive a great
deal. For one thing, if God exists and is good, and God created us with a capacity for
reason, then our using this capacity for reason is, itself good. This is, indeed, what
justifies Yacob’s rationalism. Likewise, while others may attempt to ground their
beliefs in other systems (such as divination, revelation, and astrology), those methods are ultimately inferior. For instance, revelation and divination have been used to
assert that one person should be king and that others should be their subjects. Yet,
God created all humans equally as humans, so reason reveals, not only that we are
equal, but that these other ways of forming beliefs can be systematically misguided. Yet, Yacob goes further in exploring the implications of the fact that all humans are
equal. Not only does this mean that we should be skeptical of those who use religion
to claim political authority over us, it also means that slavery is immoral and
unnatural.
 
We can see, here, that Yacob sees nature, as revealed by reason, to be the
ultimate judge of what is true and good.87 While Yacob is himself deeply religious, his
application of reason led him to deny a variety of the religious beliefs he saw around
him. We should remember that Yacob lived in a time and place of religious controversy. First, there were the disagreements between the Ethiopian Orthodox
church and Roman Catholicism inside of Ethiopia. However, Yacob also saw the
influence of Islam in most of the surrounding regions. In this way, Yacob observed
that each of these religions claimed to be the one true religion on account of
witnessed miracles. However, he points out that while all of the religions deny the truth of the other, the evidence in favor of their own miracles is the same. Everything
 
86 Rationalism was famously popularized within philosophy by Yacob’s French contemporary, René Descartes. While the two thinkers lived at the same time, and Descartes’ writings were published prior, Yacob’s writings detail his experience of coming to this view decades prior to the work of Descartes. More can be read about Descartes in the “René Descartes” chapter, and about the later rationalists he influenced in the “The Rationalists” chapter. 
87 This is a form of natural theology, which we first encountered with Thomas Aquinas.  
 
317 that the Muslim says about their miracles occurring the Christian says the same;
reason doesn’t tell us that one is more valid or true than the other. The result is that
miracles should not and do not convince us to adopt a particular religion over any
other. Likewise, there is, according to Yacob, plenty that each of these religions gets wrong. First, he looks at the endorsement of fasting by Islam and in Christian
monastic tradition. In response to this, Yacob argues that God has made us crave
food, so it can’t be wrong to eat when we are hungry. When Islam recommends
fasting during the day, this prohibition couldn’t come from God simply because we
are hungry during the day as well as the night. The same can be said of ascetic
practices of self-denial.88 However, the ascetic goes beyond denying themselves food;
monks and nuns are also celibate. In the same way, our natural sexual urges can’t be
wrong because they come from our God-given nature. Instead, Yacob endorses
monogamous romantic relationships. If celibacy is unnatural, so too is polygamy (which was not uncommon around him). In favor of this view, Yacob points out
that God has produced an equal number of men and women in the world and
created them equally. If God had wanted men to have more than one wife, he could
have easily made more women than men; the fact that he didn’t tells us that we are intended to remain monogamous.
 
Much less is known about the life of Walda Heywat, the student who encouraged Zera Yacob to write his teachings down. However, he did produce his
own work which expanded on and departed from the philosophical approach of
Yacob.89 One of his principal concerns was, like his teacher, with the diversity of
religious practices that he saw around him. However, where Yacob focused more on
the fact that reason reveals what each religion gets wrong, Heywat pays more
attention to the fact that religions can all get some things right. In this way, Heywat
argues that we should take up the method of rationalism endorsed by Zera Yacob and discover what we can learn from each religion. We can call this position
 
88 In this way, he follows Siddhārtha Gautama and Rābi’a of Basra in criticizing ascetic practices.   
89 Heywat was also at least aware of the work of early Greek philosophers whether or not it had a significant influence on his thought. We know this because his treatise refers to The Book of the Philosophers, a collection of anecdotes and sayings attributed to early Greek philosophical figures. This arrived in Ethiopia by way of the previously discussed Arabic translation movement.  
 
318 religious pluralism. Yet, Heywat goes further. In this case, just as Yacob argued that the fact that God created all people equally tells us that slavery is wrong, the
rational approach to religion and our natural equality tells us that we ought to
endorse religious tolerance. Finally, Heywat also picks up on and expands on his teacher’s account of marriage. Yacob had argued against celibacy and polygamy, but
Heywat actually gives us instructions for how we ought to behave within our
monogamous marriage. While some of what he says here would not stand up to
modern sensibilities about the equality of men and women, he, nevertheless,
admonishes husbands to be attentive to the needs and pleasure of their wives, and tells both parties to avoid marrying a prideful person.
 
Beyond the individual conclusions that Yacob and Heywat derive, it is their
approach to philosophy which lingers on most prominently. We see, in both
thinkers, a tendency to subject every belief (including those of religion) to rational investigation; no stone is left unturned, and everything must be grounded in some
firm foundation. While we have so far seen philosophy in Europe defer, in many
ways, to the authority of the church or to Aristotle, the modern era sees a turn away
from the scholasticism of figures like Aquinas and Ockham, and towards rationalism. In this way, Yacob and Heywat are pioneers of our modern ways of
thinking and investigating the world. However, it takes some time for Yacob and
Heywat’s work to arrive in Europe, so the burden of popularizing rationalism falls,
ultimately, on another thinker; one who develops the position independently and about thirty years after Yacob. That thinker is the French philosopher René
Descartes, and it is to his work that we now turn.

René Descartes 
 
If the Renaissance period was an era in which Europeans showed a renewed
willingness to depart from the established doctrines of Aristotle and the church, the
Early Modern period represents the intellectual floodgates fully opening. During this time, we see a rise in both rationalism and empiricism. To be clear, thinkers all over
the world have already demonstrated their commitment to rationally scrutinizing
their beliefs as far back as Socrates, and some have sought to provide naturalistic
explanations of the world as far back as Presocratic Greece and classical Indian philosophy. However, the Early Modern period stands out because of the now
widespread and systematic attempts at these efforts. With the reemergence of
rationalism, figures like Teresa of Ávila, Zera Yacob, and Walda Heywat endeavored
to leave no stone unturned in their pursuit of genuine knowledge. Yacob, for instance, shows a striking willingness to abandon any of his preconceived or widely
held beliefs if they fail to withstand his inquiry. Likewise, while Teresa doesn’t
depart in major ways from the established doctrines of scholasticism, she still
introduces the method of radical doubt. Yet, while these thinkers are among the first to thoroughly pursue rationalism in this systematic way, it is another philosopher
who can be credited with popularizing it within the field. This philosopher is often
said to have been the ‘first modern philosopher’ because his treatment of rationalism
is so thorough that it redirects the course of philosophy fully away from
scholasticism and towards a scientific and rationalistic model. The person
responsible for this shift is the philosopher and mathematician René Descartes.
 
Descartes was born in La Haye en Touraine in present day Indre-et-Loire in
central France (A village which now bears his name). When his mother died only a
few days after his birth, Descartes was sent by his father, a member of Parliament, to be raised in the care of Descartes’ grandmother. As a child, he was of ill-health and
 
323 spent his time studying. He was introduced to philosophy through his education,
and, at the apparent request of his father, he earned a degree and license in law at the
University of Poitiers. Upon the completion of his education, Descartes moved to
Paris and began to travel. By his own description, he spent this time intentionally seeking out conversations and experiences which were not included in the books he
had read. This time ultimately culminated in Descartes joining a Protestant
mercenary army despite his own Catholic upbringing, and this position reintroduced
him to a life of studying; this time focused on military engineering and mathematics.
This research continued until, on a cold night in November while stationed in Germany, Descartes had a series of strange hallucinatory dreams. When he emerged
from his room, he had invented analytic geometry (the system using what have come
to be called ‘Cartesian coordinates’). While he is credited with this invention,
Descartes himself contended that this discovery was actually the result of divine revelation. However, beyond the development of analytic geometry, these dreams
revealed a new purpose for Descartes’ life: the total reformation of all knowledge.
 
Upon leaving his military career behind, Descartes continued to travel,
study, attend lectures, and write. It is during this time that his interests turned more fully to philosophy (though he remained widely interested in science, philosophy,
and mathematics). After stints in Italy, Paris, and the Netherlands, Descartes took up
a position as the private tutor of Queen Christina of Sweden. However, life in the
Swedish court did not suit him. Descartes was known to sleep upwards of ten to twelve hours a day, to not leave the bed until around lunchtime, and to stay awake
until midnight. This lifestyle was especially out of step with his contemporaries, who
lacked artificial lighting and who, on average, awoke at or before dawn. In his role as
Christina’s tutor, Descartes was forced to conform to her more traditional schedule,
meeting three times a week at five in the morning. Likewise, Sweden in general and her castle in particular were both quite cold compared to the preferences of
Descartes. While he was able to conduct some research in meteorology with a fellow
French colleague living in Sweden during his time there (perhaps motivated by his
desire to avoid the cold), he was only able to meet with and instruct the Queen three times before catching pneumonia and quickly passing away. Without a dedicated
Catholic cemetery in the predominantly Protestant Sweden, Descartes was buried in
a graveyard which was reserved mostly for orphans. Yet, Descartes' story was not
 
324 quite over. Thirteen years after his death, the Pope placed his work on the Index of 
Prohibited Books and, eight years later, France’s King Louis XIV banned instruction
in Cartesian philosophy. His body was eventually returned to France and reburied in
the early part of the 19th century. However, his skull continues to be on display in the Musée de l’Homme (‘Museum of Man’) in Paris.
 
As already discussed, within philosophy, Descartes is remembered for his
role in popularizing rationalism and the method of radical doubt which have come
to be emblematic of the Early Modern period. His most famous philosophical work,
in this regard, is his Meditations on First Philosophy. This text, which is composed of six meditations, develops Descartes’ account of knowledge, the mind, philosophical
method, and God’s existence. The Meditations introduce and explore the problem
of knowledge and introduces the necessity of radical doubt. In the service of this,
Descartes is famous for raising two prominent skeptical objections to our having
knowledge: the dream argument and the evil demon.90 Here, the dream argument refers to the fact that, from inside, dreams are functionally identical to waking life.
As a result, we don’t normally realize that we are dreaming until we wake up, and
there doesn’t appear to be a systematic way to tell that we are, indeed, in a dream. As a further result, for any given moment, we might wonder how we know that we are
awake at all. Of course, our senses seem to show us that the world around us is real,
but the same is true for the appearances of things in our dreams. Thus, for Descartes,
dreams provide us with some reason for doubting the senses, and we are left needing to justify our belief in the external world. This worry arises in a different way with
the evil demon. In this case, Descartes asks us to imagine how we could know, from our own position, that we aren’t being systematically misled in our perceptions of
the external world by an evil demon. Both of these, the dream argument and the evil
demon thought experiment, push us to consider the foundations of our knowledge. What, if anything, can we really know for certain?
 
90 It is worth mentioning that neither of these issues originates with Descartes. For instance, the dream argument is discussed by earlier philosophers ranging from Plato and Aristotle to Zhuangzi and Vasubandhu. Likewise, we have already seen the idea of an evil demon deceiving us in the work of Teresa of Ávila. 
 
325
This quest for certainty is characteristic of Descartes’ foundationalism. This is the philosophical position that genuine knowledge depends on finding some
firm self-evident foundation for our beliefs that doesn’t, itself, depend on our
believing anything else. Descartes hopes to employ the method of radical doubt in order to identify what this foundation could be. Then, Descartes will attempt to
justify his other beliefs on the basis of this foundation. If this project is successful, he
will not only certain knowledge of this foundational belief, but also of all subsequent
beliefs. In this regard, Descartes focuses in on what he calls ‘clear and distinct 
ideas’. These are those that are fully present and accessible to our minds (clear), and which can't be confused with any others (distinct). If there is a foundation for all
knowledge which can survive the method of radical doubt, it will, for Descartes, be
both clear and distinct. To illustrate what he has in mind, Descartes asks us to
imagine, as a thought experiment in the mind’s eye, a chiliagon. A chiliagon is a one-thousand-sided shape. Is this shape clear to us? Probably not. When we picture a
triangle in our heads, we can picture all three sides present at the same time. By
contrast, do you really see all one thousand sides of the imaginary chiliagon? In the
same way, the mental chiliagon does not seem distinct. For instance, are you absolutely certain that the shape you are picturing doesn’t have 1,001 sides or 999?
Somehow, even though we are the ones who specified that the object we imagined is
a chiliagon, we can’t seem to be absolutely certain that it is exactly that. No,
Descartes needs a firmer foundation for our knowledge than this.
 
Yet, Descartes is still committed to the idea that the foundation of all
human knowledge would be rational, not perceptual. Beyond the fact that our senses
fail, that we could be dreaming, or that we could be deceived by an evil demon, our
senses are simply not as good as our reason for getting at the true nature of things.
Here, Descartes employs his famous wax argument. Imagine a sheet of wax in front of you. What features of the wax do you have access to through your senses? You can
see that it is solid, it feels cold to the touch, it smells vaguely of honey, and that it
makes a soft thud when you flick it with a finger. Yet, these are not essential qualities
of the wax. As you move it over a flame, you can watch as it loses its solidity, shape, coldness, scent, and ability to generate a thud when being flicked. Yet, the wax clearly
remains, and you know that the melted wax is the same wax that was present when it
was solid. How do you know this essential fact about it? Certainly not through
 
326 perception, as the senses only revealed what was inessential and accidental to its
nature. This, in Descartes’ view, shows us that reason is capable of giving us what the
senses cannot. Accordingly, Descartes feels right to redouble his efforts by looking
within for a foundation for all knowledge.
 
After prolonged meditation on what he can actually be certain of, Descartes finally arrives at an answer. The result of this inquiry is, perhaps, the most famous
single sentence in the history of philosophy: “I think, therefore I am.” This phrase,
which the Meditations render in Latin as “cogito, ergo sum” has come to be known
as the cogito. Even in doubting everything, Descartes realizes that by doubting he is thinking, and if he is thinking he must exist in order to do so. Descartes contends,
here, that this knowledge cannot be denied under any circumstances and would
remain true even if we are dreaming or deceived by an evil demon. We may be wrong
about the contents of our thoughts but, for Descartes, we can’t be wrong about the
fact that we exist at least enough to think them.91 However, notice that this is a
limited view of ourselves. We might be certain that we are thinking our thoughts,
but we can’t be as sure that our bodies exist and in which way. After all, we may just
be a ‘brain in a vat’. The consequence of this is, for Descartes, that we are ultimately ‘thinking things’. This is Descartes’ account of the self. However, we should notice
that this model establishes a real divide between the mind and the body; a division
that Descartes will endorse.
 
Descartes’ dualism is notable for a few reasons. First, it is a form of
substance dualism. One interpretation of the mind-body problem is that the brain and mind are two different things; this is just dualism. However, we might still want
to know more about this account, and, in this regard, stories differ. On one version,
we might think that the mind is just what the brain does. Notice, however, that this
still makes them two different things. For instance, digestion is what our guts do, but we can still distinguish between our digestive organs and the process of digestion;
there are things that are true for one but not the other and vice versa. In this version
of dualism, our organs are substances and digestion is a process. However, according
to substance dualism, the mind and brain are both discrete and independent
 
91 We should note the similarity between this conclusion and that arrived at by Ibn Sīnā through his ‘floating man’ thought experiment. 
 
327 substances, they are simply different kinds of substances: brains are extended in space
and have shape, minds aren’t and don’t. While most of the versions of dualism we
have so far seen have been forms of substance dualism, Descartes’ account is so
closely associated with the position that it is sometimes known as ‘Cartesian dualism’. Yet, Descartes also says more about the relationship between the body and
mind. Here, Descartes is committed to a form of interactionism. This means that causation can run both ways; events in the mind can cause our bodies to act (e.g.,
your belief that there are cookies in the cabinet and your desire to eat them together
form the reason for your going to the cabinet) and events in the body can cause effects in the mind (e.g., your lack of food causes you to feel hungry).
 
Yet, if radical doubt allows us to know that we exist as thinking things, the
burden is still on Descartes to derive the rest of our knowledge from that. It would,
after all, certainly be a shame if this was all we could know and nothing else follows from it. In the Meditations, Descartes attempts to do this by way of a cosmological
argument for God’s existence. The fact that we exist, even if only as thinking things,
means that we must have some cause for our existence. After attempting to rule out
every other option, Descartes concludes that this cause must be God. This conclusion serves as the bridge from the cogito back to our ordinary beliefs. The
existence of a good God renders an evil demon powerless; a good God can prevent
this situation from arising and would not systematically deceive our senses. With
that, Descartes begins to climb his way out of radical doubt on what he takes to be firm ground.
 
With a meager six meditations and only armed with the chair he sits in,
Descartes takes himself to have provided an account of all knowledge, giving it a
certain foundation which does not rely on or appeal to the authority of Aristotle or
the church. In turn, Descartes’ meditations set in motion a grand sweeping of rationalism across Europe. Philosophers coming after him will both challenge and
defend his views and his philosophical and scientific methodology. The most
immediate group of his successors is a wide-ranging and diverse collection of
philosophers known as the rationalists.

The Rationalists 
 
With the publication of the Meditations on First Philosophy, Descartes had
fully pushed philosophy into the Early Modern period. The absolute authority of
the church and of Aristotle had fallen out of favor and, as a result, it was now up to each individual person to decide for themselves what beliefs were rational. As we
might expect, this attitude and its effects rippled throughout society. Kings had long
justified their power and authority based on religious beliefs and their rulings based
on that authority alone. Now, subjects were beginning to expect a rational justification for the political order of the day. Why does God approve of your ruling
over others when the reason that God gives us tells us that humans are equal? Why
should the king be allowed to do what they want to and with their subjects? Subjects
of the state, in the Early Modern period, have many questions and want just as many answers.
 
The same is true in the case of religious beliefs and church authority. This is
largely consistent with a general trend from the Renaissance and Reformation
period, but it reaches its peak during this time. Religious figures had long justified
their authority based on revelation, but now were expected to justify their claims to power based on rational theology. Since the development of the printing press, and
the translation of the Bible out of Latin, each person was now deciding for
themselves how to interpret the text and what, exactly, it entails. Likewise, religious
explanations of the natural world have been more fully called into question. The model which imagines humans, and therefore the Earth, as the center of the physical
universe had fallen out of fashion in favor of mechanical and naturalistic
explanations. However, this situation runs deeper still. The Catholic Church’s
endorsement of Aquinas and his scholasticism had set the stage for any subsequent explanation. While there was room for disagreement among Christian thinkers, all of
 
331 the competing parties assumed the basic building blocks that came down from
Aristotle and Aquinas. Even the Protestants, having abandoned papal authority, still
adopted much of this framework whether they were formally required to or not. By
the Early Modern period, thinkers began to start from scratch. While they may or may not be convinced of Descartes’ account of the necessity for radical doubt, the
independent rational pursuit of a firm foundation for all knowledge was taken up,
and philosophers at this time are becoming willing to develop their own systems
from the ground up.
 
While this so-called ‘Age of Enlightenment” had implications for politics, philosophy, religion, and science, it takes different shapes depending on the region of
Europe or depending on which of their predecessors a thinker is reading. The results
of this are that those on ‘the continent’ (e.g., France, Germany) begin to pursue this
project generally in one way, while those in Britain tend to take another approach. Accordingly, scholars used to refer to these approaches as ‘continental rationalism’
and ‘British empiricism’ respectively. However, these terms have fallen out of favor
in recent years. One issue is that they are imperfect terms. As we will see, there are
British thinkers who are best thought of as rationalists and philosophers in France
who are best thought of as empiricists.92 Likewise, none of the figures alive at the
time would have recognized these camps. Each develops their own account, and they
often synthesize the best parts of each view in new and interesting ways that defy
categorization. Finally, those within the same camp (that is, two so-called rationalists) are more than willing to criticize each other’s views. Using the terms
‘rationalist’ and ‘empiricist’ often gives the impression that there are clearly defined
teams, and that there is considerable agreement within a team. This is not always the
case.
 
Nevertheless, it may be helpful to know that most (but not all) of the figures covered in this chapter share in common some basic ideas and assumptions.
 
92 Beyond those covered in the “The Empiricists” chapter, there are many other French empiricists, such as Étienne Bonnot de Condillac (who worked out a strongly empiricist theory of mind which is referred to as sensationalism), Claude Adrien Helvétius (who argued for the intellectual equality of all humans and for the importance of education), Julien Offray de La Mettrie (who argued against the belief that humans have souls which distinguish them from animals), as well as Denis Diderot and Paul-Henri Thiry d’Holbach. 
 
332
However, their similarity is more like a family resemblance than it is like they all meet
some strict definition. For example, one member of the family might have a nose
resembling another but eyes like a third member of the family. Yet, the second and
third may not have any features in common at all. Nevertheless, we might say that
they (across all three family members) share a certain family resemblance.93 The same
is true, intellectually, about the accounts of various ‘rationalist’ thinkers. What, then,
are the features which are often in common among the rationalists? One is belief in
the supremacy of reason. We have already seen, as far back as the debate between the
Presocratic Milesians and Eleatics, that reason and sense experience can come into conflict. Likewise, we saw that, in general, Plato preferred a reasoned approach
involving universal concepts whereas Aristotle preferred the scientific and particular.
These lines also generally (and vaguely) divide the rationalists from the empiricists.
The rationalists tend to think that reason is the ultimate judge and tend to raise concerns about the reliability of our senses. This was, at least, certainly evident in the
work of Descartes. Yet, as we saw, Descartes was also a scientist; he did work in
engineering and meteorology. However, at the end of the day, Descartes is willing to
throw out what is revealed by observation if it does not conform to the demands of reason. Likewise, an emerging topic of concern will be the problem of knowledge. In
particular, there is a general divide between the rationalists and empiricists on the
basis of whether or not we have innate ideas. These are ideas, concepts, beliefs, or
knowledge which we are born with, and which don’t require any experience with the world to learn or to justify. For Descartes, we have innate knowledge of our own
existence as a thinking thing. The fact that this belief is true regardless of whether
what we experience in life is real demonstrates, for Descartes, that it is not dependent
on facts about our sense experience. This position can be called innatism. By contrast, because empiricists contend that all knowledge comes from sense
experience, there can be no such innate ideas.
 
Despite these general commonalities, we should always and at every point
keep in mind that any given thinker is their own person, and that they are capable of
and more than willing to discard these ideas. Indeed, as we have already mentioned,
 
93 This model for understanding categories, which appeals to a metaphor with family resemblance, comes from the 20th century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. More can be read about the model and about Wittgenstein himself in the “Analytic Philosophy” chapter. 
 
333 they have no loyalty to the ‘continental rationalist’ team because that term does not
exist during their lifetimes. So, with this background knowledge in place and these
qualifiers out of the way, we can now turn to the rationalists of the Early Modern
period.
 
Elisabeth of Bohemia 
 
Elisabeth of Bohemia (born Elisabeth Simmern van Pallandt and also known as Elisabeth of the Palatinate) was born as the oldest daughter to Frederick V
and Elizabeth Stuart in Heidelberg, Germany. Two years after her birth, her father
was appointed King of Prussia as part of the conflict between Catholics and
Protestants which both claimed control of the region. However, his reign did not last long, as he lost his claim and title around a year later during the Battle of White
Mountain (a battle Descartes happened to be present for). Frederick was ridiculed as
the ‘Winter King’ on account of his rule only lasting one winter, and the family
(including, eventually, the young Elisabeth) were forced into exile in the Netherlands. There, Elisabeth was educated widely in topics ranging from
astronomy and philosophy to history and jurisprudence. The extent of her education
and her passion for learning eventually earned her the nickname ‘The Greek’ among
her siblings due to her proficiency with ancient languages. By the time she was a young adult, she had already turned down an incredibly beneficial proposal of
marriage due to her unwillingness to convert to Catholicism and, instead, favored a
life of the mind. It is clear that she was widely read and widely respected for her
intellect; she earned a dedication at the beginning of one of the philosophical works of the bishop Edward Reynolds, possibly due to her early feedback on a draft, and
she began to correspond with Descartes after reading his Meditations on First 
Philosophy. She continued pursuing her interest in Cartesian philosophy even when
she was sent to Germany after her brother was killed in a duel. There, she took about promoting Descartes’ work to local professors, corresponding with him throughout
this time. Yet, as we have already seen, women were pressured during this period to
either marry or to join a convent, and Elisabeth (like many women philosophers
 
334 before her) chose to do the latter. In this case, she joined a Lutheran abbey in
Hertford, Germany. She remained there for the rest of her life, eventually being put
in charge of the convent and the surrounding area. Under her management, the
community became known as a refuge for marginalized religious adherents and was renowned for its religious tolerance during a time in which, as we have seen, conflicts
between various Christian sects often led to bloodshed. Yet, it is her philosophical
work that is now most remembered. While she never published her views, historians
of philosophy can now analyze her ideas through her surviving correspondence, not
only with Descartes, but also with other intellectual figures of her day, like the Quaker thinker William Penn.
 
Elisabeth’s primary philosophical contributions can be found in her
correspondence with Descartes, which she began after reading and in response to his
Meditations. While the work discusses topics ranging from knowledge to God, her concern is with Descartes’ account of the mind. Recall that Descartes endorses both
substance dualism (the position that the brain and mind are two fundamentally
different kinds of things) and interactionism (that events in the brain can cause
events in the mind and events in the mind can cause events in the brain). For Descartes, we know that the brain and the mind are distinct because the brain is
extended in space and has a shape. By contrast, it would be strange to say that the
mind weighs so many pounds, or that it is so many inches in diameter. This tells us,
for Descartes, that the mind is an immaterial (thinking) thing, and the brain is a material (extended) thing. Thus, the two are distinct.
 
Despite an interest in the work of Descartes and a tendency to promote him
to others, Elisabeth is not entirely convinced of this picture. In her correspondence
with him, she raises a seemingly devastating objection which remains an important
philosophical question to this day; this is the problem of mental causation. Descartes has severed, like all substance dualism, the brain and mind into two
different realms. However, he also claims that the two can affect one another (i.e., his
interactionism). Our mental experience of sadness can cause our bodies to cry, and
our bodies being depleted of food can cause the mental feeling of hunger in us. Yet, we might wonder how the mental causes the physical. Everywhere around us
physical events are caused by physical objects and processes. Our finger pressing a
button is caused by a physical stimulus in the nervous system acting on the muscles
 
335 in our hand. In turn, this stimulus in our hand was caused by neurons firing in the
brain. The physical world which includes our body is governed by the laws of
physics and those laws describe physical objects acting on one another. How,
Elisabeth asks, can an immaterial mind cause a physical body to move? After all, the concept of a triangle is immaterial, and no one has ever been pushed off a cliff by the
concept of a triangle. Indeed, how physical bodies interact causally is dependent on
their physical features. The size and shape of a car will determine how much drag it
experiences as it moves, and this will determine how much energy it imparts on the
object it runs into. If the mind has no size or shape, how can it interact with the body, and what governs this interaction? This problem, raised for the substance
dualist, is the problem of mental causation. The seeming impossibility of reconciling
the mind’s immateriality and its ability to cause physical events drives Elisabeth to
deny Descartes’ substance dualism. It is simply easier to imagine a material mind, she tells us, than it is to imagine something immaterial acting in the material world.
However, while she does seem to endorse a form of materialism (in thinking that the
mind is extended in space), she still views it as distinct from the body. Thus, what is
true of the brain is not necessarily true of the mind and vice versa, but the mind is nevertheless extended and, as such, inhabits the world of the body. We can call this
position on the mind-body problem naturalistic dualism.
 
While the problem of mind-body interaction is a serious one for the
substance dualist, Elisabeth of Bohemia is not content to stop there. Recall that Descartes has so far defined the mind as a thinking thing. What we know about it is
what we can be certain of from a position of radical doubt, and that is merely that it
is a thing capable of thought (even if those thoughts are the result of deception).
However, Elisabeth is unsatisfied with this account. A genuine understanding of a
thing will not only tell us what it is capable of, but what it is. Further, a full picture of what a thing is should tell us what it is about that thing that makes it capable of
the abilities it has. For instance, consider a grasshopper. A grasshopper is certainly
capable of jumping, but few among us would be satisfied with a definition of
‘grasshopper’ that simply reads that it is a ‘jumping thing’. To be fair, the mind’s ability to think is more unique than a grasshopper’s ability to jump. However, this
story still doesn’t tell us how and why the mind is capable of thinking. In the case of
the grasshopper, we appeal to facts about their evolution and physiology to tell us
 
336 why and how they are able to jump so successfully. Yet, if the mind is simply a
thinking thing, we are no closer to understanding why it thinks the way it does, and
what makes it capable of thinking in a way that a chair is not. This, along with the
problem of mental causation, raises serious concerns for the prospects of Descartes’ interactionist dualism.
 
Beyond the philosophy of mind, Elisabeth also broached the topic of moral
philosophy with Descartes as well. While it does arise as a major topic in the
Meditations, Descartes’ account of virtue argues that we need not always succeed in
doing good in order to be virtuous. Instead, we must only intend to do good.94 However, Elisabeth points something interesting out about this view. That is that it
excludes the possibility of moral luck. As an illustration, consider the difference
between murder and attempted murder. Imagine someone breaking into a house
with the intention to murder another person. They carefully plan out the crime and everything plays out according to this plan. However, months after the murder, the
investigation is complete and the suspect is charged with murder. Now imagine that
the same person plans, in the same way, to commit the same crime. However, this
time, as a matter of total luck, the neighbor across the street is home because their kid’s soccer practice was canceled. The neighbor happens to see the suspect enter the
home, calls the police, and they arrive before the murderer can finish the job. This
suspect is, in turn, charged with attempted murder. The level of blame that we assign
for these two efforts is radically different and the resulting punishments are also different. Yet, both suspects had the same intention: to murder. If what matters
morally is just our intentions, then both should be blamed and punished the same.
However, in our society, these two things are treated as distinct crimes and result in
different punishments. If we are happy with the way that society and the law is
currently arranged, distinguishing attempted murder from actual murder, then that seems like a problem for an account of morality which only considers our intentions.
 
94 In this way, Descartes’ view bears some resemblance to that of Peter Abelard and Héloïse 
d’Argenteuil. Likewise, the German philosopher Immanuel Kant will famously defend a similar position as well. More can be read about Immanuel Kant and his moral philosophy in the “Immanuel Kant” chapter. 
 
337
Margaret Lucas Cavendish 
 
 
Having not ventured far in the timeline of rationalism, we have already run
into our first problem case for the label ‘continental rationalism’; the British
philosopher Margaret Lucas Cavendish (born Margaret Lucas and sometimes known as Lady Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Thames). In
contrast to Elisabeth, Cavendish (then Lucas) did not receive much of a formal
education as a child. Luckily, however, one of her older brothers was a well-known
scholar in his own right, and a founding member of the Royal Society, and so she was able to learn through dialogue with him. However, at a young age, she applied
and was accepted to become a maid of honor in the court of then Queen Henrietta
Maria. While this did give her come independence, it also spelled the end of her time
in Britain for a while. Shortly after Cavendish becoming a maid of honor, the Queen and her husband, King Charles, became embroiled in the English Civil War. This
conflict ultimately resulted in the death of Charles and the Queen being exiled to
Paris. Margaret Lucas accompanied the Queen to Paris, and it was there that she first
encountered the nobleman Willian Cavendish, who she would marry.
 
Her marriage to William would turn out to be a great intellectual benefit for
Cavendish, as he was known for organizing large meetings of Europe’s most
influential intellectuals. Among its members, this ‘Cavendish Circle’ could include
Rene Descartes, along with some of his major critics (such as Pierre Gassendi and
Marin Mersenne).95 The ideas and figures attended to at these meetings would eventually find their way into Cavendish’s own writings, which she was able to
publish on account of her well-connected husband. Yet, despite being an especially
prolific producer of published writing among women of the time period, Cavendish
struggled to get male thinkers to take her ideas seriously. She attempted to correspond about her work with many famous intellectuals of the time but, when
 
95 The British empiricist philosopher Thomas Hobbes was also known to have attended some of these meetings. More on Thomas Hobbes and his philosophical work can be read in the “The Empiricists” chapter. 
 
338 their responses were dismissive at best, she opted instead to write in the form of
letters to an imaginary third-party, where she would carry out the debate in their
absence. Likewise, she also wrote and published a significant number of non-
philosophical works, including a novel titled A Description of a New World, Called the Blazing World, which might be the first known work of science fiction. She
continued writing and published on a wide range of topics through her exile and
eventual return to Britain until, shortly before her death, she received some
recognition of her intellect by receiving an invitation to participate in a meeting of
the Royal Society.
 
In terms of her philosophical views, Cavendish follows Elisabeth in
endorsing materialism. However, her materialism is quite different from many of the
versions we have so far seen. Historically, materialism is often associated with
atomism. Whether we are discussing Kaṇāda’s Vaisheshika school or the atomist school of Democritus and Leucippus, we are told that all there is are atoms and void.
By contrast, Cavendish denies that the atomic theory will ultimately explain the
foundations of the natural world while, at the same time, also denying Descartes’
substance dualism. Accordingly, before we can turn to her own view, we should understand her criticisms of atomism. First, she is living in a post-Cartesian world.
Descartes had argued that material things are defined by their being extended in
space. However, Cavendish contends that anything that is extended in space is
measurable. That is, it has some length, width, and height. These are quantities of space that it takes up. The issue is that anything with quantity is also divisible. Take
something that is only one femtometer long (one quadrillionth of a meter). If we
were careful enough and had a sharp enough knife, we could always cut this object
into two half-femtometer long objects. These, in turn, could be cut into four
quarter-femtometer long objects and so on. It is only when we get to something with a length of zero that divisibility isn’t possible in principle, and that thing fails to be
material on the Cartesian view. Unfortunately, atoms are supposed to be, by
definition, indivisible units of being. This contradiction leads Cavendish to conclude
that atomism ultimately fails as a materialist theory.
 
Beyond this, Cavendish also argues atomism will fail to capture the organic
unity of natural objects. Trees are trees, not merely swarms of atoms. They are
bound together in a way that the atoms of a bird and the branch it sits on are not.
 
339
Yet, if there is only atoms and void, then there is nothing that binds together the
atoms of the bird and distinguishes them from the atoms of the tree. Of course, we
might say that they are clumped together in an especially dense arrangement shaped
like a tree, whereas the density of the bird-shaped clump of atoms is more varied. Natural objects, Cavendish argues, are discrete wholes; they are not like swarms of
bees.
 
How, then, does the material world work? While Descartes had endorsed
substance dualism, he did not stop discussing the material world and focus
exclusively on the world of the mind. Rather, he viewed the physical realm mechanically. The rise of mechanical engineering and the development of elaborate
systems of gears for things like clocks were both influential on and, in some ways,
made possible by Descartes’ mechanical philosophy. With machines, we can trace
phenomena in the present (e.g., this gear being in that position) back though a causal chain involving different parts acting on one another. Likewise, the project of
understanding such a machine involves breaking it down into its basic parts and
seeing how they act upon one another in order to achieve some outcome. The
mechanical philosophy of the early modern period, as exemplified by Descartes, sought to apply this framework to the natural world. The position tells us that
nature behaves like a machine. The teleological approach to nature that had
dominated intellectual life under scholasticism had explained the natural world in
terms of Aristotle’s four causes. This. in turn, mean that how something functions is a matter of why it is the way it is, or its final cause. What divine or natural purpose
does the thing fulfill? By contrast, Descartes’ mechanical philosophy sought to
change our way of inquiring. Instead of asking why something behaves the way that
it does (and answer in terms of its independent and essential nature), we should ask
how it works. This question is a matter of observing the movements of its parts and posting laws which can describe and predict its future movements. For Descartes,
this extends even to us. Our bodies are like complex machines and our immaterial
souls are the drivers of those devices. To use a modern analogy, Descartes views the
body as something like a remote-control car being operated by the mind, and he argued that we can even identify the antennae by which the car receives this signal,
the brain’s pineal gland. Descartes even went so far as to construct an ‘automaton’ or
moving mechanical replica of his daughter when she died at a very young age.
 
340
Margaret Cavendish is skeptical of this emerging mechanical philosophy. In
her view, mechanical philosophy must thread a particularly narrow needle between
attributing too much and too little order to the universe. If the world is like a
machine, then we should expect it to be incredibly regimented. Yet, people behave differently from one another, puppies from the same litter have different patterns of
fur, and no two snowflakes in the same snowstorm look identical to one another.
Whether we are dropping a ball from the same height over and over again or
comparing the petals of a single flower, we are, all around us, surrounded by an
enormous degree of variability in the way that natural objects behave. On the other hand, there are certainly regularities in nature. We can describe general patterns and
trends. However, if nature follows strict laws, then it would either be perfectly
regimented or fail to work entirely (like a poorly designed machine).
 
The difficulty of threading this needle leads Cavendish to deny the mechanical philosophy and return to the project of explaining the natural world
according to the internal natures of things. However, this does not mean reverting to
Aristotelian scholasticism. Instead, Cavendish endorses a position known as
panpsychism, or the view that all natural objects possess some level of consciousness. The mechanists of her day will follow Descartes by explaining
physical causation in terms of one object passing its motion to another.96 For
instance, one billiard ball is moving across a pool table until it makes contact with
another ball. Then, the motion of the first ball passes to the second ball, which causes it to continue the trajectory of the first. Cavendish does not deny the passing
of motion from one object to another but, rather, that this has the mechanical
implications that Descartes and his followers think. Instead, Cavendish argues that
what has motion has knowledge, and that the causing object passes its plan of
motion onto the affected object. While it might seem strange to say that one ball plans to go somewhere and it passes this information to the second, the view is not
 
96 Isaac Newton’s theory of the conservation of momentum (then considered a contribution to natural philosophy but now considered a posit of physics) would not be published until around thirty years after the time that Cavendish is writing. The same is true for Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz' theory of kinetic energy. The two theories would then not be reconciled until the work of Émilie du Châtelet in another sixty years. Leibniz is discussed in a later section of this chapter and more can be read about du Châtelet and her philosophical views (along with Newton) in the “The Empiricists” chapter.
 
341 entirely strange. For instance, on a modern physical theory, two planets floating
nearby each other through space will be ‘attracted’ to one another on account of
their mass and will eventually collide if they are not being acted on by outside forces.
In turn, we can ask whether the now collided planets perceived one another. Of course, answering yes seems to attribute some level of consciousness to the planets;
they were aware of one another. However, if they didn’t perceive each other, then
why did they travel in the right direction? If they are, as it were, flying blind, then we
should expect them to sometimes miss. Considerations like this push Cavendish
towards the view that all natural objects possess some basic level of conscious awareness, knowledge, and motion. This, in turn, could help her address the mind-
body problem. If everything has some natural materialistic mental activity, then it
should not be difficult to explain how the mental and the physical interact. For this
reason, modern panpsychists, who (like Cavendish) argue that all matter is in some way conscious, argue that it is our best hope for explaining how a mind could emerge
from the physical world at all; consciousness is always present, living objects just get
better at storing and passing more complex forms of information.
 
Anne Conway 
 
Anne Conway (sometimes referred to as Lady Anne Conway and born Anne Finch) was born in London and raised in what is now known as Kensington
Palace. Little is known about the circumstances of her education other than the fact
that her brother studied under a Platonist philosopher at Cambridge named Henry 
More, and that More agreed to instruct her as well due to her inability, as a woman,
to legally enroll at the university.97 This meant that her philosophical education was,
like Elisabeth of Bohemia before her, done primarily through the mail, and was
 
97 More was a prominent critic of the doctrine of predestination (or the view, espoused by John Calvin, that because God knows everything and governs all things, God knows and decides the way that the future will be and, therefore, there is one determined way that the future will be). He was also known as a member of the Cambridge Platonist school. More can be read about the Cambridge Platonists in the “The Sentimentalists” chapter. 
 
342 primarily concerned with the work of Descartes. Unlike Elisabeth, however, Conway
did eventually marry. Her husband apparently encouraged her intellectual life and,
together, they built an enormous and renowned private library. As she grew older,
health problems which had been present throughout her life led her to hire a live-in physician. This doctor, in turn, introduced her to Jewish mystical practices and
Quakerism. The influence of the former led her to abandon her Cartesianism and
she converted to Quakerism just before passing in middle age. However, unlike
Elisabeth of Bohemia, modern philosophers are not limited to reading Conway’s
correspondence. In the time between her introduction to Jewish mysticism and her death, Conway wrote and published a work in Latin known as The Principles of the 
Most Ancient and Modern Philosophy. This work gives us insight into her thoughts
on philosophy of mind, her criticism of Descartes, and also of her challenges to the
views of her former teacher Henry More.
 
Despite criticizing More in her work, the views that Conway puts forward
retain some of the Platonic character that she inherited from him. She develops her
own independent metaphysical picture which, like the Neoplatonists, has a hierarchy
of being with God at the top. However, in her model, this structure consists of only three levels. God is primary because he is perfect in his wisdom, justice, and
goodness. Beneath God is Jesus, who characterizes the ‘middle nature’, and which
connects God to the final tier; the creatures. What is especially distinct about
Conway’s view is that this final category, ‘creatures’, contains all of the physical things. While people often distinguish living ‘creatures’ from nonliving ‘things’,
Conway argues that all material things are living and, as such, capable of motion and
perception. In this way, Conway follows Cavendish in endorsing a form of
panpsychism. However, Conway’s argument for her panpsychism is very different
from Cavendish’s, and it has religious and moral implications as well. Like many of those that have come before her, Conway argues that God is good, and that God
created the world in his image. As a result, the world is both good and like God.
However, Conway claims that since God is living, if the world is like God, the world
must also be living. On her view, immaterial substance runs counter to God and, thus, must be abandoned. This represents a criticism of Descartes’ view because he
had argued that the physical and the mental were two distinct realms. Descartes’
substance dualism requires the existence of immaterial and unthinking matter
 
343 because that is what the body is made out of. Thus, where Elisabeth of Bohemia had
denied substance dualism in favor of materialism, Conway’s criticism is that the kind
of inanimate matter that Elisabeth was committed to cannot exist; everything is
animated. This fact is, for Conway, what makes us like God; that we have the same capacities that God does on account of our being alive. In turn, our highest good is
in following the ‘middle nature’ of Jesus towards emulating God and, as such,
perfecting these capacities within ourselves.
 
Baruch Spinoza 
 
We have seen so far that Descartes casts a large shadow over Early Modern
rationalism, and this is no surprise given that he is often credited with being the
founder of modern philosophy. However, after Descartes, Baruch Spinoza (sometimes referred to by the Latinized Benedict de Spinoza) is widely considered
the second of the three most influential figures in the movement. Spinoza was born
into a middle-class Portuguese-Jewish family that had settled in Amsterdam in the Dutch Republic. Accordingly, he received a traditional Jewish education in a
yeshiva, learning Hebrew, Dutch, and Latin in addition to his native Portuguese.
Unfortunately, however, Spinoza was forced to suspend his schooling and take up
work in the family business when his older brother passed away. This continued for some time, until the death of Spinoza’s father caused a feud within the family. His
mother had died shortly after his birth, so his father’s passing opened up the
question of inheritance among his surviving siblings. A bitter conflict, resulting in
his declaring himself an orphan and suing his sister for control of the estate, ended with Spinoza having achieved financial independence. This, in turn, allowed him to
pursue philosophy and the emerging science of optics.
 
Spinoza’s interest in philosophy eventually led him to adopt a number of
then radical beliefs about Judaism, including the view that Moses didn’t write the
Torah and that scripture allows for the possibility that God has a physical body. Perhaps predictably, these beliefs landed Spinoza in trouble with the local Jewish
community. In one instance, he was attacked on the street by a man with a knife and
 
344
Spinoza responded by continuing to wear the now torn coat for years afterwards.
However, the controversy around his philosophical beliefs came to a head when
Spinoza was excommunicated from the Jewish community of Amsterdam. Despite
being excluded from much of social and religious life in the city, Spinoza still spent the majority of his time there. He earned a modest living using his early study of
optics to grind lenses for the now booming scientific demand for microscopes and
telescopes. He was apparently quite good at this, as the Dutch astronomer Christiaan
Huygens, who discovered Saturn’s moon Titan, was an adamant proponent of
Spinoza’s work as a lens manufacturer. While his job as an artisan was not as prestigious or as highly paid as that of a scholar, this income was enough to secure
him intellectual independence. In fact, he turned down employment as the chair of
the philosophy department at the University of Heidelberg for fear that it would
require that he censor his views. Unfortunately, however, this occupation would also eventually contribute to Spinoza’s downfall. He died from lung disease in The
Hague in the Dutch Republic at the relatively young age of 44, a result of a lifetime
of inhaling glass dust as a lens grinder.
 
It should be no surprise, given the way that his religious beliefs defined the course of his life, that Spinoza’s most influential and well-remembered ideas concern
his account of God. Indeed, when asked about his own religious beliefs, the famed
physicist Albert Einstein replied that he believed in “Spinoza’s God”.98 What, then,
was Einstein committing himself to exactly? Like those Early Modern rationalists before him, Spinoza’s work takes shape in the context of Descartes. Substances, for
Descartes, are distinguished by their independent existence. While the process of
digestion requires a digestive system in order to be realized, the digestive system does
not require the process of digestion in order to exist. This tells us that the digestive
system is the substance and digestion is a mere process; a property that digestive systems can realize. This, in turn, informs Descartes’ theory of mind. Because the
mind and body are independent, the mind does not rely on the brain to support its
existence. The two are, simply, two different substances. This is, after all, why his
view is called ‘substance dualism’. The implication of this independence is that the
 
98 Mark Livio, “Einstein’s Famous ‘God Letter’ is Up for Auction,” Scientific American, October 11, 2018. https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/einsteins-famous-god-letter-is-up-for-auction/. 
 
345 soul can, as many dualists throughout history have claimed, survive the death of our
physical bodies. Spinoza will build on some of the basic ideas here and push them
out in an entirely new direction.
 
Spinoza follows Descartes' account of substance and argues that substances
are defined by their independent existence. However, Spinoza points out that the logical implication of this view is that God is actually the only real substance that
exists. Sure, there is a certain sense in which our hearts can exist on their own in a
way that our heartbeats can’t, but they ultimately still rely on other things to come
into and maintain their existence. Our bodies only exist because of our parents and their bodies only exist on account of their own parents. Ultimately, this chain of
dependence reaches all the way back to whatever first exists, which is not caused by
any other thing. That thing, for Spinoza, is God. Descartes was well aware of this
implication and endorsed it in a limited sense. However, Spinoza is less convinced that we can limit the consequences of this idea. Spinoza argues that, just as the state
of ‘currently beating’ is a way that a heart can be and ‘currently digesting’ is a mode
of operation for the digestive system, all of the substances we see around us (e.g.,
frogs, people, trees, cars) are just a way that the one true actual substance, God, can be. Streams, fur, airplanes, supernovas, and us ourselves are all just modes of God’s
existence. Of course, we should note that all of these things are natural objects. The
universe, or nature, is our term for all that is, and everything in it is merely a
patterning of it. Thus, God is all that really exists, and God is identifiable with nature. In this way, Spinoza arrives at a very similar view to that of most of the
orthodox schools of classical Indian philosophy. Both endorse monism, or the view
that there is only one fundamental kind of thing in reality. Likewise, both views take
that one fundamental thing to be identifiable with the divine. This makes Spinoza,
like the Presocratic Parmenides, a pantheist. The view is most often expressed in Spinoza’s short Latin identification of the underlying nature of reality: ‘Deus sive
Natura’ (‘God or Nature’).
 
It is worth pointing out that while we have motivated Spinoza’s claim that
God is the only independently existing substance because of a chain of causation (e.g., our parents cause us to exist), this is not exactly Spinoza’s view. This kind of
causation depends on the cause being prior in time to the effect. By contrast, Spinoza
thinks that our dependence on God is immanent. That is, our existence is, in each
 
346 second, dependent on God. To illustrate this, Spinoza draws on the example of a
triangle. Triangularity (the essence of being a triangle) doesn’t cause the triangle to
exist by existing prior to it and acting on some raw material in order to cause the
triangle to come to be. Rather, triangularity is ever-present in the triangle, and it is a necessary feature of it. This, in turn, can tell us something about the natural world.
God’s existence is, like the triangle’s triangularity, necessary. God was introduced
into the theory because he is the substance with independent existence. If this
existence is one of the defining features of God, then it as necessary as a triangle’s
triangularity. However, since we are merely ways that God, as the natural world, is, then our own existence is necessary too. God has the ability to take the shape of your
uncle, a Saturn V rocket, and a car crash, and so those things must be realized. This
leads Spinoza to endorse determinism; everything in the universe is playing out as it
must because these things and events are just the necessary unfolding of all of God’s ways of being. It is clear that this line of reasoning had an impact on Einstein, who,
in addition to endorsing Spinoza’s view of God, famously said that “He does not
play dice.”99 Nothing in the world is random, and nothing (including our own
decisions and actions) are outside of this causal unfolding.
 
Nicolas Malebranche 
 
Descartes was certainly a religious believer; the existence of God is crucial,
on his account, to get us knowledge of anything other than our own existence.
However, in the eyes of many, the rationalism that he advocated for would spell the
end of religious life. If every person is their own judge of what is true, the whole of religious authority is called into question. The project of systematically reevaluating
every belief in the light of reason might, for some believers, amount to nothing more
than telling each person to ignore the body of philosophical insight developed up
until now in favor of doing their own (untrained and uneducated) research. What could this movement accomplish other than to lead people astray from what experts
throughout history have known to be true and good. Of course, Descartes was
 
99  Livio “Einstein’s Famous ‘God Letter’ is Up for Auction”. 
 
347 careful to develop his own proof of God’s existence which he thought any rational
person could and should arrive at on their own. This was apparently enough to
convince the French philosopher Nicolas Malebranche, who made it his mission
to demonstrate the compatibility of Descartes’ work and that of Augustine of Hippo.
 
Malebranche was born into a wealthy and well-connected family, with his
father being the Secretary to King Louis XIII. However, due to an issue with the
development of his spine, he was forced to receive his education from private tutors.
As was standard in the period, this education focused primarily on scholasticism. At sixteen, Malebranche began to study philosophy and theology at the University of
Paris. However, in the same year that Malebranche was ordained as a priest, he
encountered and read Descartes’ Treatise on Man. The text apparently had a
profound impact on him as he describes having to take frequent breaks from reading to calm his heart and breathing. While Malebranche had already soured on
scholasticism by that point, Descartes had given him a path forward outside of it,
and he immediately set about on a ten-year period of intense Cartesian study. This
project culminated in a series of works and exchanges in which he outlined his own rationalist philosophy. These ideas, like those of Descartes and Spinoza before him,
were subject to an enormous amount of controversy. His critics, who ranged from
scholastics to fellow Cartesians, managed to have his work added to the Catholic
Church’s Index of Prohibited Books. Academic life, with its controversies, would continue on like this until his death in Paris at the age of 77.
 
Unlike many of the post-Cartesian rationalists we have discussed so far,
Malebranche treads closer to Descartes in endorsing dualism. This, for Malebranche,
proceeds from the method of radical doubt as outlined in the Meditations. We know
that we must exist because we are able to think and to doubt and, like Descartes, Malebranche does not think that this will directly justify our sense experience. We
could, after all, be dreaming or deceived. However, Malebranche then turns away
from Descartes’ story for reasons that reflect Elisabeth of Bohemia’s skepticism
about his account. In this case, Malebranche recognizes that Descartes has told us what the mind does (i.e., that it is a thinking thing), but that gets us no closer to
knowing what the mind is. Introspection can tell us that we think, feel pain and
happiness, and desire, but it can’t tell us the nature of the mind, thought, or emotion
 
348 as such. Yet, unlike Elisabeth, this does not make materialism seem more plausible
for Malebranche. Rather, Descartes’ argument that the mind is not extended in space
is sufficient to ground Malebranche’s’ dualism. The issue of knowing the mind’s
nature is just that, an issue of our knowledge of the mind, not an issue of its separate existence. It may be the case that the essence of the mind is not, fundamentally, its
ability to think. Indeed, we may never know the nature of the mind, but we can at
least know that it exists and that it is not material.
 
While Malebranche has addressed one of Elisabeth’s concerns, he has not
yet addressed the other: the problem of mental causation. What’s more, Malebranche is equally skeptical of the immaterial mind’s ability to cause events in
the material world. Again, however, Malebranche draws different conclusions from
this worry. Where Elisabeth thought that the best available option was to conclude
that the mind must be material, Malebranche appeals to a higher authority: God. Descartes’ mechanical philosophy argued that causation was a matter of necessary
connections. For instance, when one gear acts on another gear, the second gear must
move, and the second gear requires the first gear to initiate and transfer its motion.
On top of this we can add Descartes’ account of clear and distinct ideas: we are justified in believing something only when we are able to grasp it fully and plainly
with our minds. What this is not true of, Malebranche argues, is the very necessary
connection that mechanists argue exists connecting objects. We say that we have a
clear and distinct idea of the causes of things but are easily misled. As evidence of this, Malebranche points to earthly pleasure. We might crave a large slice of
chocolate cake and then, when we eat one, conclude that the happiness we now feel
is caused by the cake. However, rational reflection will ultimately tell us that God is
the cause of all happiness. Thus, our grasping of the cause can be systematically
misled. Further, this story points at the true nature of causes. God not only causes the happiness that we feel when we eat chocolate cake, but actually is the cause of all
things at every moment. This extends from the gear seeming to cause the movement
of another to our beliefs and desires seeming to cause our actions and to one thought
leading to another. Causation in the material world, in the mental world, and between the two is always a result of God. Accordingly, the dualist is not on the
hook for explaining how the immaterial soul causes events in the material world; an
all-powerful God is the cause of all things, and there is no trouble explaining his
 
349 power to cause (it’s right there in his job description). Thus, Malebranche, like his
forebear al-Ghazali, endorses a form of occasionalism.100 
 
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz 
 
The final of the three most influential Early Modern rationalists is
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Leibniz was born in Leipzig, Germany three years
after the publication of Descartes’ Meditations on First Philosophy. His father, who was, himself, a philosophy professor passed away when Leibniz was only six. This
made Leibniz the sole inheritor to his father’s massive private library, which he was
given free access to from a young age. Further, since this library was almost entirely
written in Latin, Leibniz became fluent in the language by twelve and was writing extensively in it within a year. At the age of fourteen, Leibniz enrolled in university,
and he emerged with a master’s degree in philosophy less than three years later,
shortly followed by a degree in law. Leibniz followed this up by applying for a
doctorate in law at the age of nineteen. When the University of Leipzig denied his application due to his youth, he simply went elsewhere, earning the doctorate at the
University of Altdorf instead.
 
Upon finishing his studies, Leibniz turned down a role as an instructor at
the University of Altdorf, opting instead to work as an assistant to the German politician Christian von Boyneburg. This work continued for some time until he
was sent to Paris as part of negotiations between Germany and France. By going to
Paris, Leibniz had entered into the intellectual center of Europe; he met with
Christiaan Huygens (the astronomer using Spinoza’s lenses), interacted with
Malebranche, and studied then unpublished works by Descartes. This four-year period resulted in an enormous burst of productivity. Leibniz established himself as
a mathematician and as a scientist; independently and simultaneously inventing
calculus at the same time that Isaac Newton was in Britain, making advances in
 
100 Occasionalism was also adopted by some other Early Modern rationalists, such as the Dutch philosopher Arnold Geulincx, whose work is closely related to Spinoza’s.  
 
350 geometry, topology, and linear systems, and developing a steam engine, the concept
of kinetic energy, and the binary system used today in computing.101 Despite the
success of his work during this time, Leibniz’ life in Paris ended when he was recalled
to Hanover. During his return trip to Germany, Leibniz managed to secure an extended stop in The Hague, meeting with Antoine Philips van Leeuwenhoek (who
had just discovered microorganisms) and Spinoza (who had just completed his
magnum opus in philosophy). Leibniz kept up this kind of public intellectual life
even upon returning to Germany; he befriended Sophia of Hanover, sister of
Elisabeth of Bohemia, and was personally visited by Tsar Peter the Great of Russia. Yet, by the end of his life, Leibniz had fallen out of favor with the elite. While
modern historians of math believe him to have developed calculus independently of
Newton, Newton himself (along with the British establishment) accused him of
plagiarism. This led to an extended public international dispute. Unfortunately, Leibniz died before he could be fully vindicated. His funeral was poorly attended,
few scientific societies commemorated his life and work (including two which he was
a member of), and he was buried in a grave which remained unmarked for decades.
 
In order to understand the philosophical conclusions that Leibniz comes to, along with his reasoning, it may be helpful to begin by discussing a number of
principles which will guide his thinking. Some of these rules for reasoning were
developed by Leibniz and others were commonly asserted at the time. However, they
figure prominently into his thinking, and they will remain with us in our study of philosophy through history, so it is important to discuss them now. Likewise,
Leibniz spending the time to articulate and defend rules of reasoning demonstrates
the extent to which philosophers during this time period are struggling to endorse
the independent thought of the individual, whose reason is the final judge for the
truth of all beliefs, while still maintaining some guardrails against intellectual anarchy. The goal of developing these principles is not only to ensure that we are
reasoning well, but to ensure that everyone arrives at the same results. With that
being said, the principles that Leibniz endorses are as follows:
 
101 While Leibniz is most often credited with developing the binary system which evolved into the one that we know today, he was inspired to do so by works of Daoist philosophy that he read. On his interpretation, the yin and yang correspond to zero and one respectively.   
 
351
1.   Law of identity: Everything is identical with itself, or that
everything is what it is (e.g., what is red is red, what is big is big).
 
2.   Identity of indiscernibles (Leibniz’s law): There can’t be two
separate objects which share every property in common (i.e., If
everything that is true and false about one thing is true and false
about another, then those are the same thing).
 
3.   Law of noncontradiction: Two contradictory propositions can’t
both be true in the same sense at the same time (e.g., dogs cannot be
both animals and not animals).
 
4.   Principle of sufficient reason: Everything must have a reason,
cause, or ground (e.g., the ball going through the window causes the
window to break, your having to go to work is the reason for your
getting up in the morning).102
 
5.   Principle of the best: Beings, insofar as they are rational, always act
for the best (e.g., people act according to what they think is best).
 
6.   Predicate-in-notion principle: The predicate is contained within
the subject for any true proposition (e.g., his being a philosopher is
somehow contained within a complete understanding of Plato).
 
With these principles in mind, we can now move to Leibniz’s metaphysics.
 
102 While many philosophers throughout history have endorsed the principle of sufficient reason, some have raised problems for it. For instance, the medieval French philosopher John Buridan is often attributed with a thought experiment (known as Buridan’s ass) which, while developed prior to Leibniz’s time, is often seen as a challenge to his principle of sufficient reason. Here, we are supposed to imagine a hungry donkey equally situated between two equally good and full bags of feed. Because the donkey isn’t closer to one and neither is better than the other, we can wonder what reason it would have to choose one or the other. Thus, while the donkey seems to have reason to eat from some bag, it doesn’t have reason to eat from either one. Given that the donkey will, likely, simply choose one in order to avoid starvation, this decision must be arbitrary and without sufficient reason (or so the story goes).  
 
352
Recall, for a moment, Margaret Cavendish’s reason for denying atomism:
 
1.   Atoms are material and indivisible.
2.   If x is material, then x is extended.
3.   If x is extended, then x is divisible.
4.   Therefore, atoms are divisible.






5.   Therefore, the existence of atoms is contradictory
(they are both divisible and indivisible).
 
This argument was sufficient to convince Cavendish that atomism must be false, and that there must be some divisible material as the foundation of reality. By
contrast, this same line of reasoning leads Leibniz to conclude that atoms must be
immaterial. After all, the issue is whether atoms can be extended in space (that is,
material) and indivisible at the same time. Where Cavendish asserts materiality and denies indivisibility, Leibniz simply goes the other way; he endorses indivisibility and
denies materialism. While this does allow him to preserve something like an atomic
theory, it is a very different sort of atomic theory than we have seen so far. These
atoms are, for Leibniz, fundamental substances, but they but that does not make
them the only real things in existence. On a regular atomistic theory, we are composed of atoms and, as such, are not fundamental parts of reality ourselves. By
contrast, Leibniz argues that we, as individuals, are atomic. Yet, how does he get
there?
 
Remember that Aristotle has already argued that the substances are those things which we predicate of but don’t predicate of anything else. We predicate of
the table that it is hard and of Leibniz that he was a mathematician. By contrast, we
don’t predicate of anything else that it is Leibniz (other than the man himself).
Leibniz follows this basic model. However, complete knowledge of a particular substance would mean knowing all and only true predicates about that thing. To
fully know who Leibniz is requires knowing that he was born in Leipzig, that he
developed calculus, that he was an Early Modern philosopher, and so on. Thus,
according to the predicate-in-notion principle, these things are, in some sense, in the
essence of Leibniz’s substance. Further, a complete list of these will identify Leibniz as an individual; the law of identity tells us that these are true of him and the identity
of indiscernibles tells us that they are true only of him. Thus, according to Leibniz,
 
353 our own individual substance (that is, our essence) is a complete concept of all of the
true predicates of us. This is perfect, the story goes, because we already have good
reason for thinking that atomic substances are immaterial, and concepts are
immaterial. These substances, which Leibniz argues are immaterial, atomic, complete
concepts, he calls monads.
 
To be clear, this is a strange and counterintuitive view for many. Leibniz has
argued that the world is made up of immaterial atoms and that, at bottom, reality is a
set of independent concepts. This is strange for a number of reasons. First is that
there seems to be a material world. How, then, do we make material things out of immaterial monads? Leibniz’s answer is simply to deny that such material things
exist in this way at all. Sure, we see animals, rocks, trees, airplanes, and planets.
However, all that is given to us is perceptions of these things which, in turn, are ideas
in our mind. Thus, Leibniz (like Vasubandhu before him) endorses a form of
idealism.103 Beyond this, however, there is still the relationship between ideas.
Substances are supposed to be complete ideas yet, some substances seem to rely on
each other in order to take on their complete identity. For instance, it is included in
the complete concept of Leibniz that he was accused of plagiarism by Newton. However, this being true of Leibniz seems to be on account of Newton. Had
Newton not accused Leibniz, then this would not be true of his essence. Yet,
substances are supposed to have a complete and independent existence. Further, this
essential fact about Leibniz appears to be entirely contingent and essences are usually taken to be necessary features of a substance. This means that Leibniz must have a
story about how objects in the apparently physical but actually immaterial world
interact and act causally on one another. This brings him to the problem of
causation. Leibniz’s answer to this problem is the theory of pre-established 
harmony. While it seems like Newton caused it to be true that Leibniz was accused of plagiarism, this was always and already true of Leibniz. In fact, it is in Leibniz’
essence that he would be accused of plagiarism by Newton, and it was in Newton’s
 
103 Idealism will famously be defended by the philosopher George Berkeley. A modified form of idealism will also become dominant in Germany in the time after Leibniz, especially under the influence of the philosopher Immanuel Kant. More can be read about Berkeley in the “The Empiricists” chapter, more can be read about Kant in the “Immanuel Kant” chapter, and more can be read about post-Kantian German idealism in the “The Idealists” chapter.    
 
354 essence that he would accuse Leibniz of plagiarism. These two facts, for Leibniz,
aren’t true because of one another and neither one is chronologically nor
ontologically prior to the other. Rather, the two essences merely mirror (or are
harmonized with one another). This basic picture applies to every case of causation; the ball doesn’t cause the window to break, it was in the window’s essence to be
broken at this time and it was in the ball’s essence to fly through the window at that
time. To help explain this, Leibniz draws on the image of two clocks that are
perfectly in sync. Each clock mirrors the other, but this is not because one is causing
the other to conform to it. Rather, the two clocks are merely in harmony. Notice, however, that this means that our decisions are part of our essences, which means
that we are locked into making them and those that are affected by them are locked
into facing their consequences. If Newton was always going to accuse Leibniz of
plagiarism, then he had no real freedom to do otherwise. Likewise, Leibniz could do nothing to stop Newton, including failing to develop calculus. This means that the
theory of pre-established harmony commits us to determinism. This was enough for
the English philosopher Damaris Masham (sometimes referred to as Lady Damaris
Cudworth Masham) to dismiss the theory altogether. In her view, our experience is one of choosing and of acting. If Leibniz’ theory tells us otherwise, then that is only
reason to reject it. Perhaps, then, Leibniz has saved necessary essences but at the
expense of free-will.
 
There is one final thing which will complete Leibniz’ theory: his account of God. Leibniz accepts Descartes’ ontological proof of God’s existence and, on the
basis of that, believes that there is a perfect God who is responsible for the world.
Leibniz accepts Descartes’ proof of God’s existence and, on the basis of that, believes
that there is a perfect God who is responsible for the world. This makes sense given
the harmony that Leibniz seems between all monads. God must be responsible for this harmony as it would require a great deal of rationality in order to secure it.
However, we can know more about God as well. According to the principle of the
best, rational beings act for the best.104 Of course, our view of things is sometimes
limited. We aren’t, after all, perfectly rational. This makes sense of why we often fail to actually do what is best. Yet, if God is perfectly rational, then God would always
 
104 Socrates also endorsed the principle of the best, arguing that humans always choose to act according to what they think is virtuous, whether or not it actually is. 
 
355 do what is best. This, in turn, means that our world is the best of all possible 
worlds. The problem of evil concerns our ability to reconcile an all good, all-knowing, all-powerful God with the suffering and evil we see in the world, and now
Leibniz has given us an answer to it; the apparent needless suffering we see around us is actually part of a divinely good and rational plan. While we may think that the
world could or should be better than it is, this is only because we aren’t as rational
and all-knowing as God. The suffering we endure in this life is only a minor
necessary side-effect of an otherwise maximally rational and good system.
 
Anton Wilhem Amo 
 
By this point, we already have good reason to deny the strict distinction between the ‘continental rationalists’ and the ‘British empiricists’. First, Descartes
and Leibniz are both thoroughly scientific thinkers. They contributed to our
understanding of physics and used observation of the natural world to build
machines. If empirical knowledge is equated with scientific knowledge, then both philosophers are quite scientific. Further, there were also numerous figures who
were, in fact, British and not from mainland Europe. Here we can think of Margaret
Cavendish and Anne Conway. However, the last philosopher we will mention
should put the final nail in the coffin of this distinction, and for a number of reasons. For one thing, he was not born in Europe at all (mainland or otherwise).
Instead, his story begins in Africa, where we first encountered Early Modern
rationalism in figures like Zera Yacob and Walda Heywat. Likewise, his philosophical
views will serve as a bridge between the rationalist Descartes and the empiricists to come. This philosopher, who perhaps best blurs the lines between the categories
‘rationalism’ and ‘empiricism’ is Anton Wilhelm Amo (also known as Antonius Guilelmus Amo Afer).
 
Amo was born in the town of Axim, in what is now Ghana. He was of
Nzema origin (a subgroup of the Akan people). Little is known about the earliest part of his life, but we do know that he was transported by the Dutch West India
Company to Amsterdam around the age of four. It is unclear whether this was the
 
356 result of his being enslaved or his being sent by a preacher who the young Amo was
in the care of. In either case, once arriving in the Netherlands, he was presented by
the Dutch West India Company as a gift to the family of Anthony Ulrich, a local
Duke. The removal of children from Africa to be gifted to noble families was not uncommon in Europe at the time. Colonization had created significant interest in
and romanticization of the colonized world, whether that was Africa, the Middle
East, or East Asia. As such, powerful aristocratic families often sought or obtained
children from those parts of the world so that they could adopt, patronize, or
employ them in their court, partially in order to satisfy their own curiosity and often in order to appear ‘cultured’ and important to their peers.
 
Amo is recorded in the historical records as a servant to the family in early
adulthood but is widely regarded as having been treated like another son of the
family. Accordingly, he received an education comparable to what other noble people of his day would; he studied philosophy, physiology, astronomy, history, law,
medicine, politics, and religion and became fluent in English, French, Dutch, Latin,
and Greek. In turn, he attended law school at the University of Wittenberg in
Germany as the first known person of African descent to attend a European University. This work culminated in his defending a thesis arguing for the rights of
Africans under Roman common law (which was still seen as having force in Europe
at the time). Amo followed this up by completing a doctorate in philosophy at
Wittenberg and by subsequently taking up a job teaching at the University of Halle (also in Germany). However, shortly after transferring to the University of Jena,
things took a turn for the worse for Amo. The death of his patron came at the same
time that the political climate in Germany took a conservative turn.105 This
culminated in Amo being publicly mocked in a theatrical production in Halle.
Conditions eventually got bad enough that Amo contacted the same company that had brought him to Europe as a child, the Dutch West India Company, and he
contracted to have them return him to Ghana. At this point, Amo’s story gets
slightly less clear. On some accounts he was held at a Dutch fortress out of fear that
 
105 This same conservative turn also resulted in the rationalist philosopher Christian Wolff being exiled from Prussia when he was accused of atheism after defending Confucian moral theory and Leibniz’ account of pre-established harmony.    
 
357 he would incite dissent amongst the local people, on others he is reunited with his
father and sister, and in others, still, he takes up work as a diviner and astrologer.
 
Amo’s philosophical work stands out because of his tendency to synthesize
rationalist and empiricist thought. Like most of the other thinkers we have discussed
so far, this work focuses on the philosophy of mind and centers itself in response to the work of René Descartes. Indeed, Amo’s chief ambition seems to be to be more
Cartesian than Descartes. Recall that Descartes is both a substance dualist and an
interactionist about the mind. On this view, the mind and body are two distinct
kinds of things which interact causally with one another; our beliefs and desires can cause our bodies to move and, for instance, our physical experience of pain in the
body can cause the feeling of pain in the mind. The problem, as we have already seen,
is in spelling out the details of this picture. For example, Elisabeth of Bohemia asked
how, exactly, an immaterial mind causes events in the body. However, Amo’s concern actually runs the other way; he is skeptical that events in the body can cause
events in the mind. Ultimately, he concludes that the mind can act causally in the
physical world, but that the mind cannot be acted upon by physical events. We can
call this doctrine the impassivity of the mind.
 
As evidence in defense of the impassivity of the mind, Amo focuses on
sensation as a central case. On a standard story, we see an object out in the world
(say, a dog). The image of this dog then impresses on our perceptual organ (i.e., the
eye) like a key being pressed into a bar of soap. In turn, the mind forms an idea of the
dog in accordance with this ‘sense impression’. This causal history is what makes our idea of a dog be about that dog. We can call this position on how the mind works
representationalism.106 What’s more, representationalism offers us an obvious and
complimentary theory of truth. In this case, our idea of the dog is true and good
insofar as it resembles the dog in the world (in the same way that we have a good mold of the key insofar as it is identical with the actual key). That is, true beliefs
correspond to the reality we perceive. This view has come to be called the
correspondence theory of truth. Even though Descartes thinks that some of our
ideas are innate to us, and thus aren’t formed in this way, he is nevertheless a
 
106 As we will see, representationalism will remain popular, in some form, throughout the remainder of the history of philosophy. 
 
358 representationalist about perceptual knowledge. Notice, though, that this story
requires that the body’s perceptual organ have the capacity to cause events or ideas in
the mind. Since Amo is denying the body’s ability to do this, it is there that he
focuses his attention.
 
In response to representationalism, Amo defends two central claims: that sensation is something that happens in the body, and that the body’s sensation is
causally independent of the events of the mind. In the first case, Amo points out that
sensing or perceiving are activities that living things engage in; rocks don’t perceive
things (assuming that Conway and Cavendish’ panpsychism is false) and neither do abstract concepts like ‘largeness’. In turn, Amo points out that living requires the
circulation of blood. Since the mind is immaterial, it doesn’t circulate blood, and
since it doesn’t circulate blood, the mind isn’t living. This means that the mind
cannot engage in processes and activities which only living things do, like sensing and perceiving. However, the body does circulate blood, so sensing must happen in the
body. With that out of the way, Amo must now turn to the question of body-to-
mind causation. Here, we should return to Descartes’ account of the mind as a
thinking thing. Elisabeth of Bohemia had worried that this view accounts for the mind entirely in terms of what it does and not in terms of its nature. Amo’s claim is
that this story does tell us something about the mind’s nature; namely, that it is
fundamentally active. If the mind is entirely characterized by the abilities it has, then
it is by its nature active. To have a mind is to think and to think is to actively engage in thought. However, if the mind were to think on the basis of a sense perception in
the body, then it would need to be sitting around passively waiting for new signals to
cause events in the mind. Here, we have a tension between the mind’s nature as an
active thing, characterized in terms of what it does, and its needing to be passive and
receptive to the inputs it receives from the body. On the basis of this, Amo sides with Descartes’ account and simply denies that the body causes events in the mind.
 
This story might lead us to conclude that Amo endorses the theory of pre-
established harmony presented by Leibniz, in which both substances (mind and
body) exist as separate entities, and in which neither causes events in the other. However, Amo still thinks that the mind can cause bodily events. On his positive
view of the mind, it is always actively observing the body from a distance and making
judgements about perceptions happening in the body. We aren’t caused to think of a
 
359 dog by seeing a dog. Rather, our minds spontaneously form the idea of a dog after
seeing that the body has perceived one. The distinction between this model and the
model put forward by representationalism is a peculiar one, but the principal
difference is in terms of which party (the brain or the mind) is acting causally in order to bring about our ideas. How, then, does the mind cause events in the body?
Here Amo is less clear. He does tell us that the mind can use the body as an
instrument, but he does not answer how. It might be that he is satisfied with
Descartes’ story about the pineal gland, or it may be that we simply don’t have
advanced enough science to know yet. In either case, Amo takes himself to have clarified the directions in which mental causation can and can’t run.
 
With Amo’s distinctive theory of mind out of the way, we might still
wonder how, exactly, his work is empirical. Everything we have so far discussed
seems to be in line with Amo’s fellow rationalists, even if it is a unique view. In this case, we see, in Amo, one of the central tenets of much of Early Modern empiricism.
While Amo builds off of the rationalist Descartes, he also departs in a significant
way. Where Descartes thought that we had innate ideas which were not reliant on
our sensory experience of the world, Amo holds that there is nothing in the mind which was not already in the senses. This is the core of the empiricist tradition. If this
is right, we are born with minds like empty canvases, and it is only through
interacting with the world that we can build up sets of ideas. The topic of innate
ideas, along with its implications for how we ought to reason and how the mind works, will take up much of the focus of the empiricists. It is towards them that we
now turn.

The Empiricists 
 
In order to understand the Early Modern empiricists, it is important to have
some historical background about at least two major developments; those
concerning science and those concerning the British state. We have already seen, in discussing the rationalists, that the ‘scientific revolution’ is currently underway.
Whereas Descartes and Leibniz played a central role in establishing the mechanical
philosophy of science in mainland Europe, in Britain, the development of science as
a separate discipline from philosophy is largely due to the influence of Francis 
Bacon, Robert Boyle (founding member of the Royal Society), and Isaac Newton. In its earliest days, the Royal Society was heavily influenced by a new approach to
natural philosophy which was advocated for by Bacon, and which has come to be
known as the ‘scientific method’. This model tells us that we can best understand the world by generalizing from our observations, and that we can make better
generalizations about the world by systematically observing natural phenomena
under different conditions.
 
Whereas thoroughly scientific thinkers like Galileo did test their theories in
the physical world, they were also just as happy to develop thought experiments in order to draw conclusions about the natural world. While actual experiments and
thought experiments were already both established tools within natural philosophy,
and both would and do continue to be used in physics, the establishment of the
Royal Society pushed the trajectory of natural philosophy further in the direction of the observational method. The success of this project is tied up with the popularity
of empiricism. Recall that empiricism tells us that knowledge is primarily or
exclusively obtained through sense perception. If this is right, then it makes sense to
observe nature systematically, so that we can get a clearer idea of the world. Likewise, as engineers and scientists were better able to produce more elaborate and
 
363 sophisticated structures and technology, that only seemed to provide further
evidence that empiricism was on to something. Indeed, Francis Bacon’s famous
declaration that ‘knowledge is power’ can be read as making this exact point.
 
In terms of affairs of the state, there are two developments which will set the
stage for the philosophy to come. While rationalists seem to have paid special attention to issues concerning the mind, mental causation, and God, political
philosophy will play a large role in the empiricist tradition. Of course, questions of
causation and the mind are not entirely absent here, but just as social chaos in the
Greek Hellenistic period had consequences for their theorizing, the same is true in Britain. This is, in large part, due to the British Civil Wars. The British Civil Wars
were a series of conflicts which took place in Britain and within a span of roughly a
decade and a half. While these wars are complicated in their causes, having to do with
taxation, religion, political authority, and political representation, it should, for our purposes, be enough to say one major thing about them. When different competing
governments each claim that they are the true and proper government of England, of
Britain, or of the Empire, we must have some way of sorting out who is right. This is,
in some part, a question of who is and ought to be entitled to rule, but it is as much a question of when we might be entitled to overthrow a government. In this way, the
British Civil Wars play a similar role in British philosophy that the Warring States
and Spring and Autumn periods play within Chinese philosophy: they push the
problem of political authority to the front and center of everyone’s minds. Further, just as these periods called the Mandate of Heaven into question in China, the
British Civil Wars caused doubt in the divine right of kings. This doctrine, which had dominated Europe as the most common justification of the political authority of
a monarch, claimed that kings derived their authority to rule from God. However,
where the Mandate of Heaven also meant that rebellions could be justified, the
divine right of kings permitted no such right to rebel.107
 
107 The right of rebellion was not entirely absent from European philosophy prior to the Enlightenment, however, as philosophers like the Spanish scholastic Francisco Suárez argued that legitimate rulers could lose their authority by becoming tyrannical.  In such situations, Suárez argues that it would be moral to kill such a tyrant in order to establish a more just regime. 
 
364
The second major political development was the development and
expansion of British colonialism. Colonists sent reports back to England which
described indigenous life in the Americas, Africa, and Asia. This has two major
intellectual effects. First, the radical differences between how indigenous societies structured themselves and how European societies did led to a renewed interest in
human nature. While, for instance, Plato and Aristotle had both given accounts of
what it is to be human, colonization meant a much larger sample size with which to
test theories of human nature. Perhaps, by understanding what kind of creatures we
are, we can better understand how we ought to live among one another. Added on to this is tendency among colonizers to see colonized people as being primitive. Because
the peoples that they were colonizing did not dress in clothes like theirs, live in
houses like theirs, or arrange themselves into social roles like theirs, European
thinkers sometimes believed that observation of indigenous life could provide a more accurate account of human nature, because it was in a state prior to cultural
influences. Of course, indigenous communities had very advanced cultures.
Tenochtitlan, the Mexica capital of the Aztec Triple Alliance, was five times larger
than London prior to colonization.108 Likewise, we have already seen that the Mexica had advanced agriculture, arts, engineering projects, and philosophy. This was also
not unique in the Americas. For instance, the Mississippian city Cahokia (near
present day St. Louis, Missouri) rivaled London in terms of its population during the
height of its culture.109 However, while these beliefs about native peoples were false, it did not stop Europeans from thinking that indigenous peoples were more
primitive than themselves and acting accordingly. As we have already said, this meant
assuming that these cultures represented a picture of pre-civilized humans.
Accordingly, European philosophers in the early Modern period will give different accounts of what life would be like in a state of nature, and they will use accounts of
indigenous peoples to justify these claims.110 For instance, the French philosopher
 
108 Michael D. Coe and Rex Koontz, Mexico: From the Olmecs to the Aztecs (London: Thames & Hudson, 2008).  
109 Matthew Wills, “The Mysterious Pre-Columbian Settlement of Cahokia” JSTOR Daily, August 15, 2017, https://daily.jstor.org/the-mysterious-pre-columbian-settlement-of-cahokia/. 
110 We first encountered the concept of a state of nature in the work of the Chinese legalist philosopher Han Fei.  
 
365
Jean-Jacques Rousseau took the view that human nature was mostly pleasant and agreeable and that social problems were largely the result of the development of
civilization. Here, he erroneously asserts that indigenous Americans lacked
metallurgy and agriculture and, “for that very reason have always continued
savages”.111 Beyond this, however, beliefs about the so-called ‘uncivilized’ nature of
indigenous peoples would also factor into philosophical accounts of property and
justifications of colonization.112 If property rights emerge hand-in-hand with the
process of ‘civilization’ (as Rousseau argues) and native peoples aren’t civilized, then
they lack property rights over the lands they inhabit and the resources they maintain. This ties together the philosophical question of what property is and how we can
come to have property rights over particular objects, which we can call the problem 
of property, with the project of colonization. Now, with this historical background
out of the way, we can turn to the philosophical work of the Early Modern empiricists.
 
Thomas Hobbes 
 
Just as many consider Descartes the father of Continental rationalism, we
may think of Thomas Hobbes as the founding figure of British empiricism. Little is
known about his early life other than that he was born into a religious family in the town of Westport in southwest England. Hobbes, himself, believed that his mother’s
hearing of the Spanish Armada’s invasion caused her to go into labor and deliver him
prematurely. Of this, he said that his mother gave birth to twins: himself and fear.
Despite his father’s apparently not valuing education, Hobbes did eventually Oxford, where he resisted a traditional scholastic education in favor of pursuing his
 
111 Jean-Jacques Rousseau, “A Discourse Upon the Origin and the Foundation of the Inequality Among Mankind,” in The Harvard Classics, French and English Philosophers, ed. Charles W. Eliot (New York: P.F. Collier & Sons, 1910), 210. 112 As Rousseau’s work suggests, drawing political and social conclusions about the state of nature from reports of indigenous people was not limited to Britain, but was a larger European phenomenon during the early Modern period. Other French thinkers who address this include, but are not limited to, Montesquieu and Voltaire. 
 
366 own intellectual interests. However, his time at Oxford came to an end when he was
recommended by the University’s administration to be a private tutor to the son of
William Cavendish, uncle of the William Cavendish who was married to Margaret
Lucas Cavendish. Hobbes would tutor William’s confusingly named son, William Cavendish, and remain in the employment of the family for the rest of his long life;
even tutoring the grandson of his original employer, who also happens to be named
William Cavendish. This work eventually led to him leaving England for Paris,
where, as we have already seen in discussing the work of Margaret Lucas Cavendish,
the Cavendish family was forced to flee after siding with the Royalists.
 
It was in Paris that Hobbes first encountered mechanical philosophy, which
stood in stark contrast to the scholasticism he resisted. He visited Galileo in Florence
during his house arrest and began wading into debates in philosophy (natural and
otherwise), with his response to Descartes’ Meditation on First Philosophy was published as part of the “Objections to the Meditations and Descartes’ Replies”
along with Gassendi’s and Mersenne’s. Also like Gassendi and Mersenne, Hobbes
was an active member of the Cavendish Circle organized by William Cavendish,
husband of Margaret Lucas Cavendish. However, Hobbes’ inclusion within the British Royalist community exiled in Paris came to an end with the publication of
his magnum opus, Leviathan, or the Matter, Forme, and Power of a Common 
Wealth, Ecclesiastical and Civil. While he defended, at an abstract philosophical
level, the Royalist position, the secular nature of the book aggravated religious authorities in Europe. Thus, Hobbes resorted to returning to England. There,
however, Hobbes was still not without controversy. Even after the king was restored
to power, Hobbes’ association with secularism caused him to be accused of heresy.
He attempted to defend himself against the charges and, with the protection of the
king, was only banned from publishing on the matter in England. Ultimately, he died in his nineties, still in the house and employment of the Cavendish family. We
are told that his last words were “a great leap in the dark”, which he said shortly
before passing.
 
As his love of mechanical philosophy might suggest, Hobbes was a man of science. Despite not enjoying the actual act of physical research, he was a proponent
of the view and of the materialism which often accompanied it. This had
implications for his metaphysics and political philosophy alike. In the case of
 
367 metaphysics, Hobbes raises a new and interesting concern, which pushes the
problem of personal identity to the center of philosophical attention among the
empiricists. In this case, it is through a thought experiment about the Ship of 
Theseus. Here, the mythical Athenian king Theseus is returning to Athens from Crete by ship. However, over the course of the trip, planks and oars fall into disrepair
and must be replaced. One by one, every individual part of the ship is eventually
replaced with new parts. Ancient historians had told us, before the time of Hobbes,
that ancient Greek philosophers argued over whether the ship at the end of the
journey was the same ship as the one at the end. However, Hobbes brings this question into the domain of personal identity. He asks us to imagine that each plank
was set aside, rather than disregarded, as it was replaced. In the end, we could then
assemble a ship from all and only the original pieces of Theseus’ ship. The question,
for Hobbes, is whether the ship Theseus now uses (with all new planks) is the Ship of Theseus, or whether the alternative ship (composed of all the original parts) is the
Ship of Theseus. This is a concern, on the materialist account, because the
reconstructed ship shares the matter of the original ship but has no continuity with it
otherwise. While Hobbes, himself, gives an equivocal answer, saying that the second ship has all of the matter of the original ship but that both have the same form,
raising the problem is enough to cause later empiricists to feel compelled to address
the issue of personal identity.
 
Hobbes’ materialist mechanical philosophy also informs his political philosophy. In physics, we analyze material substances and describe their movements
and interactions in terms of natural laws. Since Hobbes sees humans as merely
extensions of the natural world, he begins his inquiry with a study of humans in a
state of nature and endeavors to derive some natural laws which could govern our
behavior the way that the laws of physics govern extended bodies moving through space. The question, for Hobbes, is what life would be like if we were to strip away
the government and social institutions which keep us in line. In this case, Hobbes
bases his account of the state of nature as much on the behavior of the English
during the British Civil War as he does on indigenous Americans. For him, life in the
state of nature would be “solitary, [poor], nasty, brutish, and short.”113 Without any
 
113 Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), 84. 
 
368 police, judges, laws, or jails, Hobbes argues that suspicion would permeate
everything. People would immediately wonder if and when their neighbors would
come for them in the night, steal their belongings, and leave them for dead. In turn,
if nothing else, these suspicious people would quickly accidentally turn against one another out of fear. In turn, some would resort to defending themselves with lethal
force and the families of their victim would seek revenge. Soon, everyone would be at
each other's' throats; one person would steal from another, the second would kill the
first to defend themselves, the family of the first would come back and kill the
second for revenge, and the family of second would begin killing the family of the first for their own revenge. This cycle of violence and theft would eventually descend
into a war of “all against all”.114 This is, for Hobbes, merely the byproduct of the fact
that we are, fundamentally, animals. We don’t object to lions preying on gazelles and
we don’t think that snakes are governed by any significant moral law. Rather, people, like all other animals, are governed by only one law: the law of self-preservation. Of
course, it is only prudent and rational that we should not willfully go around looking
for conflict, but when others refuse to cooperate with us, nature permits us to secure
our own safety and survival as we see fit. That rationality demands, in the state of nature, that we seek peace until others fail to cooperate, at which point we are
entitled to defend ourselves by any means necessary, the first law of nature.
 
The issue with the first law of nature is that people in the state of nature are
following it perfectly, and to disastrous results. Without any guarantee that others are seeking peace with us, we will continue to be suspicious of everyone and, as such,
will continue to fall back into a state of nature. This leads Hobbes to derive a second law of nature. Here, he tells us that rational agents in the state of nature must
abandon their absolute right to self-preservation in order to secure peace. However,
to accomplish the desired goal, everyone needs to do this, and everyone must do it at once. Yet, if everyone is surrendering their rights at the same time, who are they
surrendering them to, and who will secure their survival? In this case, a third party
must be appointed to serve as the ultimate arbiter of what is good, right, and true.
We can call this judge, jury, and executioner the ‘sovereign’ (or the titular ‘Leviathan’). Just as two sides might take their dispute to a judge or to a king in order
 
114 Thomas Hobbes, De Cive: The English Version (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983), 34. 
 
369 to have them decide the matter, the sovereign emerges out of this agreement in order
to end, once and for all, all disputes. We can call this way of establishing a
government commonwealth by institution.115
 
It is important to point out that while Hobbes is sometimes referred to as a
social contract theorist, this isn’t exactly right. Socrates, in the Crito, imagined himself giving up rights to the state in order to benefit from the stability and
prosperity that it produces. This is a social contract because the government and the
individual give up something and get something in return. By contrast, Hobbes’
sovereign gives up nothing; the title is established by an agreement between the
individuals that make up society, it is not some preexisting party to a contract.116 For
this reason, Hobbes prefers to refer to this agreement as a ‘covenant’, rather than as a
‘contract’.
 
How, then, does the sovereign secure everyone’s survival? Well, consider the
first issue which might arise: someone going back on their agreement to abide by
whatever the sovereign says. Once you and your neighbor agree to abide by whatever
a judge says, one party is almost guaranteed to end up unhappy. However, if you
reserve the right to object to the judge’s ruling, then we are back in a state of nature; each person can decide how to preserve themselves. If your neighbor leaves the
hearing and decides that, while the judge has made their ruling, they will not go by it,
then the judge might as well not exist. Accordingly, we must surrender our right to
object to the sovereign. The sovereign has, and must have, final say in what is good,
right, and just. Thus, while we did not have moral laws in a state of nature, we can and must have them now. Further, those laws are whatever the sovereign says that
they are. While you might want a right to a quick and fair trial, you have no grounds
to object to the sovereign not giving you one. Thus, the sovereign (usually thought
of as a king) is an absolute ruler and the absolute moral authority. The only instance in which one could reasonably object to the sovereign’s decisions is when they are
 
115 This view, that political obligations are the result of our natural capacity for reason, was also endorsed by the Dutch jurist and philosopher Hugo Grotius, who wrote roughly contemporaneously with Hobbes.  
116 A similar view was defended, around the same time that Hobbes was writing, by the German philosopher Samuel Freiherr von Pufendorf, who argued that the will of the state is just the sum of the individuals who make it up. 
 
370 going to execute you. Since the covenant only emerged in order to promote self-
preservation, it would be contradictory to say that we must follow the covenant to
our own death. We always reserve the right to go the gallows swinging, Yet, short of
this, we are to do and think as the sovereign says.
 
Now we arrive at the question on everyone’s minds during the British Civil War: when and why might a government change rulers. It seems clear, both from his
biography and from his philosophical views, that Hobbes sides with the authority of
a monarch over the demands of a parliament; the sovereign’s rule must not and
cannot ever be called into question. Their charge is to secure peace by any means necessary. So long as they are functionally able to protect citizens from each other
and from outside invaders, then their authority is absolute. However, this also tells us
precisely when a government might change hands. Should the sovereign fail to secure
safety (from within or from abroad), then they have brought us back to a state of nature. This sovereign has failed, not in the sense of doing something morally bad,
but in simply not fulfilling their function. This opens the window for the covenant
to reorganize around another sovereign. This could be the result of the prolonged
decay of civil institutions or a state of nature could happen only briefly during a siege by some outside force. In either case, a new order will eventually emerge, and it will
emerge around a new sovereign; one who guarantees order, stability, and survival.
Notice that this story is descriptive, rather than prescriptive. Where a political
theorist might tell us what a government ought to do or which kind of ruler we ought to have, recall that Hobbes views himself as a political scientist. His account is
supposed to be a descriptive science of the laws of government. This reordering of
society will happen under these conditions, and Hobbes refers to this as
commonwealth by acquisition.
 
John Locke 
 
It is difficult to overstate the importance of John Locke in the development of empiricism in the Early Modern period. Locke’s centrality is, in some part, due to
his profound influence within philosophy. Empiricists and rationalists alike will
 
371 frame their own work as a building off of or responding to the prior work of Locke.
However, his influence is also felt among the founders of the United States as well.
Accordingly, few intellectuals have had as significant of an impact on both, the
development of ideas and the development of world events, as John Locke.
 
Like Hobbes, John Locke was born into a religious family of modest means in the southwest of England (in Locke’s case, in the village of Wrington). His father,
having served in the English Civil War, was able to secure a patronage from his
former commander, and this allowed Locke to receive an excellent education, which
would have otherwise been above the family’s means. Also like Hobbes, Locke found the scholasticism he was instructed in less than inspiring. However, when
Charles I was beheaded less than a mile from where Locke was staying, the country
took a hard turn away from Catholicism and, with it, scholasticism. This gave Locke
the opportunity to pursue education in the mechanical philosophy which was gaining a foothold in England. Locke completed a bachelor’s and master’s degree
there before turning down a faculty position in order to become a medical doctor.
During this time, he studied with Robert Boyle and with Robert Hooke (one of the
early discoverers of microorganisms) and made a positive impression on the statesman Anthony Ashley Cooper (also known as Lord Ashley). In turn, Ashley
invited Locke to move into his house in London and to become his private
physician.117
 
Under Ashley’s employment, Locke carried out a high-profile life-saving
surgery on his patron and the two worked together to establish colonies in the Carolinas, with Locke being thought to have had a hand in the writing of their
constitutions. Eventually, however, Ashley, and Locke by association, came to be
accused of various political assassination plots and conspiracies at the highest levels
of government. This led to Ashely being repeatedly held and released from the Tower of London and, at one point, being moved from safe house to safe house.
While historians now believe that Locke was not actually involved, the association
 
117 Locke was also, at one point, put in charge of the education of Cooper’s grandson, also named Anthony Ashley Cooper (sometimes referred to as ‘Lord Shaftesbury’ or as the 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury). This Cooper would become a philosopher in his own right. More can be read about Cooper in the “The Sentimentalists” chapter. 
 
372 was enough to drive him to exile in the Netherlands. There he began writing some of
his most influential works. These works established his reputation once, after finally
being able to return to England, he began to publish them. Now a famous and
influential thinker in the liberal Protestant Whig party, Locke took up an extended residence in Essex at the invitation of Damaris Masham (who we have already
discussed due to her criticisms of Leibniz). The smoke and smog of London made it
hard for the asthmatic Locke to live in the city. However, in Essex, Locke continued
pursuing intellectual life, writing and meeting with figures like Isaac Newton and
England’s first poet laureate John Dryden, until his death at 72.
 
Locke follows in Hobbes’ footsteps as an empiricist. However, Descartes
and his fellow rationalists have, by now, argued that humans do have some innate
ideas. After all, the cogito was supposed to be something that we can know for
certain even if we have only ever lived as a brain in a vat or while being deceived by an evil demon. If this really is genuine and certain knowledge, and not susceptible to
radical doubt, then there is at least one bit of knowledge which does not rely on
sensory experience. Accordingly, the burden now rests on empiricists like Locke to
explain how knowledge can only come from observation by the senses. Here, Locke returns to Descartes’ innatist picture. We are told, because it can be derived entirely
from the cogito, that God’s existence is innate knowledge. However, is it true that all
humans have inborn knowledge of God? Locke points out that most children need
to be explained what God is and that people all over the world have different views about God, ranging from polytheism to atheism. If our idea of God is innate, a
straight forward implication of our innate sense of ourselves as thinking things, then
why doesn’t everyone have the same one? Why does it require children to learn
about it? Likewise, we can look at seemingly straightforward applications of reason
and find the influence of the senses as well. We can see, from reason alone, that if Socrates is a human and humans are mammals, then Socrates is a mammal. However,
our judging that Socrates is a mammal still depends on our having an idea of
Socrates, of humans, and of mammals. Surely, all humans aren’t born knowing what
mammals are, especially since mammals, as a class, weren’t defined until the 18th century.
 
As far as Locke is concerned, our minds, when we are born, are blank slates.
We have no real unified ideas or concepts when we are born. We can call this theory
 
373 the tabula rasa theory of the mind. Instead of being born with knowledge or ideas, we first encounter objects in the world and recognize them according to their
sense impressions. Imagine that you see a raccoon for the first time as a small child
and get an impression of a soft brown and gray moving object that weighs about fifteen pounds. Let’s imagine, further, that this raccoon’s name is Oscar. On Locke’s
model, you bring the sensory data that you get from Oscar together and posit a
unified object as being responsible for that data: Oscar. Any time afterwards that you
encounter a similar bundle of data (e.g., soft, brown and gray, and of the right size
and shape), you associate it with that first experience and conclude that you are observing Oscar. Later, when you see a second raccoon, you associate the soft brown
and gray sensory data from this object with the mostly matching data from Oscar
and begin to think of them as alike. As you become exposed to more and more
different objects which share some, but not all, of these features, you slowly develop a more and more sophisticated concept of ‘raccoon’. When you compare your
‘raccoon’ concept to your ‘dog’ and ‘cat’ concepts, you, again, find a range of
similarities and differences in observable features. Cats and dogs both often have
tails, but their tails are capable of different movements. Both make sounds, but one woofs and the other meows. From this, you form a concept of ‘mammal’. Finally,
you can conclude (or judge) that Oscar is a raccoon and that raccoons are mammals,
therefore Oscar is a mammal. This is Locke’s representationalist picture of
epistemology.
 
Locke’s theory is slightly more complicated than it first appears. For
instance, we should notice that the brain is not nothing before it encounters sensory
information. It is blank in terms of concepts, but not abilities. Locke admits that
capacities for reasoning, such as associating like things together and inferring
relationships, are innate abilities. The difference is that no particular ideas are innate in his tabula rasa theory. This, in turn, means that there are no judgments which are
possible without experience. Beyond this, Locke thinks that some properties we
attribute to things belong to the object and others are in our own minds. As an
example, consider a group of people gathered around looking at a can of tomato soup. Everyone sees the can as occupying the same area of space, which means that
they all attribute it the same size and shape. If they didn’t, then, when both people
reach out to grab it, one must miss, since it has to either be one way or the other.
 
374
Accordingly, we can say that size and shape belong to the object; they are objective in
a certain sense. Locke calls these primary qualities. By contrast, there are some properties which we may not agree on. For instance, two people in the group might
both say that the label is red, but how do we know that the first person’s red looks like the second person’s? You might remember this as the problem of inverted qualia,
which we discussed with the Hellenistic Cyrenaics. Locke thinks that the fact that we
might have inverted color perception, but not inverted size perception tells us that
colors are a fundamentally different kind of quality than size and shape. Color must
not actually exist in the object the way that size and shape do but must be a judgment that our mind makes about the object. Color is something that happens in our
minds. As such, Locke refers to it as a secondary quality.
 
With his theory of epistemology out of the way, we can turn to some
important implications of it. One of these implications involves his theory of the self. Hobbes had raised concerns for any answer to the problem of personal identity
which claimed that we are our matter. Like the Ship of Theseus, we are constantly
updating and replacing the material of our body. Our cells die and cycle out, being
replaced by new cells, and our bones grow and change. This means that if we are merely the atoms which make us up, then we are not the same person we were a year
ago, much less at our birth. In order to understand Locke’s answer, we should
consider his thought experiment of the prince and the cobbler. Here, Locke argues
that if the mind of a prince were to be transported into the body of a cobbler, we would then think that the person walking around in the boy of the cobbler is really
the prince. If the prince were his matter, then this simply wouldn’t make a
difference. What does this tell us? Personal identity isn’t a matter of material
continuity, but of psychological continuity.
 
One obvious objection to this account is that our conscious experience isn’t actually very continuous at all. For instance, you go to sleep and lose consciousness
during that time, so you might worry that every nap is an instance of death and
rebirth. Locke’s solution to this is to appeal to memory. For Locke, personal identity
is, like building concepts from observations, a matter of remembering. While we may lose consciousness during sleep, when you wake up, we can still remember what it
was like prior to falling asleep, and you do so from the same perspective.
Accordingly, memory is the key to psychological continuity. Even if we can’t
 
375 remember every single thing we have ever done, we can remember ourselves when we
could remember that thing. Thus, there is a chain of recollection happening which
binds all of our conscious experience together into a unified person. You remember
yourself as you were from ten years ago and that you could remember yourself as you were at five. This is what preserves your identity over time. Locke points out that this
model implicitly informs our moral and legal practices. We praise and blame people
because of what they did in the past, and this wouldn’t make sense if there was no
psychological continuity between the person being rewarded or punished and the
person who did the thing we are rewarding or punishing. To illustrate this, Locke
asks us to consider a thought experiment about the day man and the night man. This person lives a totally normal, moral, and law-abiding life during the day but,
unbeknownst to them, they sleepwalk at night committing all kinds of horrible acts.
Since the waking person doesn’t recall any of the events that take place at night and vice versa, the two are fundamentally different people even though they share the
same matter. Thus, once the person is captured and tried for their crimes, it
wouldn’t, in Locke's view, make any sense to punish the waking day man for the
crimes of the sleepwalking night man. Thus, persisting as the same identity over time involves the ability to remember past experiences from the same perspective. While
you and a friend may have a great many experiences and memories in common, you
do not share every single one, and you do not share them from the same point of
view. We can call this Locke’s memory theory of personal identity.
 
Another component of Locke’s view, which might have perhaps gone
unnoticed, is that he has committed himself to a deeply egalitarian position. If we are
all born as blank slates, then there are no inherent differences between us. All of our
learning and judgements are the result of our experience. While some people may
believe, in Locke’s time or in our own, that different races or genders have essentially different intellectual capabilities, this can’t be the case if everyone is born ignorant
and educated solely through their experience and observation. This is precisely the
conclusion that the feminist philosopher Judith Drake draws when she, a
contemporary of Locke’s, concludes that the tabula rasa theory entails the equality of men and women. Any observed differences between men and women are, in her
view, better explained by women’s diminished access to education and intellectually
enriching experiences. That access to education and opportunities is a better
 
376 explanation of these differences is seen, not only in the empiricist epistemology of
Locke, but also in variations between economic classes. Drake points out that
intellectual differences are greater between men of different classes than between
women and men of the same class. If this is right, then that is some evidence to suggest that it is variances in experience, rather than nature, which drives the
apparent differences between genders.
 
Another question we might have about Locke’s theory is how we come to
know moral truths if all knowledge is just a matter of sense experience. For one thing,
we never observe the wrongness of murder. We might witness a murder and see that it makes victims and their families sad, but we don’t observe, directly, its wrongness.
That murder is bad must be some other form of knowledge, then. A variety of
responses have been offered here. First, we should recall that Locke does allow us to
make further judgments from the observations that we experience. Just as we judge Socrates and Oscar the raccoon to be mammals, we can also judge that murder is bad
by applying reason to the concepts we develop through observation. Other defenses
take a different approach. Damaris Masham, who we can recall as a friend and
supporter of Locke’s and as a critic of Leibniz, argues that it is Locke’s empirical model that forms the basis of morality. We saw that she resisted Leibniz’s theory of
pre-established harmony because it did not allow for human choice, and as such,
moral agency. Here she tells us that closely observing the world around us on the
empiricist model will lead to the recognition and love of God. In turn, God reveals the rational basis of morality through natural moral laws. Thus, empiricism provides
a basis for natural theology, and natural theology provides a basis for morality.
Meanwhile, in her defense of Locke’s philosophy, Catherine Trotter Cockburn
(another contemporary of Masham and Locke) follows a similar but distinct
strategy. Here, Cockburn agrees with Masham’s account of empiricism as a basis for natural theology, which can serve as a bridge to moral knowledge. However,
Cockburn argues that moral knowledge comes from understanding our own human
nature. It is enough to say that natural theology can show the existence of a divine
creator and that God created us as equal human beings sharing in a common human nature. This observation, for Cockburn, can serve as the foundation of morality.
 
While Locke doesn’t fully address the problem of moral epistemology
directly, Cockburn’s answer does resemble his own work on political philosophy,
 
377 insofar as it centers on the question of human nature. Like Hobbes, Locke develops
his political theory by imagining a state of nature. However, this does not cause him
to share in Hobbes’ dim view of human instincts. To illustrate Locke’s view, imagine
a group of people who become shipwrecked on a deserted island. Since there are no people there when the survivors arrive, none of the island's natural resources belong
to anyone. There is no government operating on the island and there are no laws to
regulate the behavior of survivors. Those who now find themselves stranded on this
island are, functionally, in a state of nature. Locke begins by pointing out that this
lack of government does not mean that one person is entitled to go around calling themselves a king and forcing everyone to harvest coconuts for them. There is
nothing, in the state of nature, that would justify that person’s authority over others.
The natural world is, in Locke’s eyes, the world of God’s creation, and God created
us humans as equal participants in it. We, in some sense, belong to God as natural beings, and thus no other mortal person is permitted to steal us from God.
Accordingly, no one can claim dominion over anyone else. For Locke, this tells us
that we have a natural right to life and liberty. In some sense, we own ourselves, and
no one else can reasonably claim to treat our lives, bodies, or efforts as their own belongings.
 
Yet, Locke hopes we can say more. As we have already pointed out, no one
owns any of the natural resources on the island yet. However, imagine that you were
on the island and, shortly after arriving, set up a shelter, fetched a bucket of fresh water from a stream, and harvested a few mangos for yourself. Then, in the middle of
the night, you return from your shift keeping watch for passing boats only to find
that someone else is currently in your hut, eating your mangos and drinking your
water. If our right to property is a civil right (i.e., one that a government gives us),
then none of these things are your property in the first place, and you have no standing to suggest otherwise as there is no government to grant you that property.
Locke thinks that this seems wrong. We would, in fact, object to someone taking our
shelter, our water, and our mangos, and that means that we have a natural right
(i.e., one that we possess by nature) to property. The problem is, then, in explaining how these things became yours when they belonged to no one earlier that day.
Locke’s solution to the problem of property is to say that you come to own
something when you ‘mix your labor’ with it, and we can call this the labor theory 
 
378 of property. You mixed your labor with the mangos when you picked them, you mixed your labor with your hut when you built it, and you mixed your labor with
your water when you fetched it from the stream. After all, when you yell at the
person stealing your mangos, you tell them to go pick their own. This tells us that your picking them is what confers their status as your property. With that, Locke has
arrived at natural rights to life, liberty, and property.118 
 
Of course, we might agree to trade our labor; we could trade the mangos we
picked for the coconuts that someone else picked, or we could agree to build a shelter
for someone in exchange for protection from others. Since we own our labor, we are also free to decide how to give it up. On the other hand, there are also limits to how
many public goods we are allowed to take into our possession. We couldn’t, for
instance, run immediately from the beach and gather up all of the coconuts on the
island (except for a few moldy ones) while others helped the wounded survivors. While we would have mixed our labor with them, Locke argues that our natural
right to property requires that we leave ‘enough and as good’ for others. The other
limitation that Locke places on this process is that we are only allowed to take as
much as we can use before it will spoil.
 
The problem with this picture comes when someone violates another
person’s natural rights. In a state of nature, you are entitled to punish the person
who stole your mangos in the same way that you are entitled to defend yourself.
However, as we have already seen with Hobbes, this could lead to a dark place. Locke
doesn’t necessarily think that humans would arrive at a war of all against all, but there would certainly be some people who would want to take advantage of others.
Accordingly, we would want to reach some kind of agreement with one another in
order to at least ease our suspicions. Without a government, there will be general
confusion on the island about what is or isn’t acceptable behavior and islanders are vulnerable to attack from those on nearby islands who may want to steal resources.
Accordingly, this agreement would regulate the use of force on the island and ensure
 
118 As a testament to Locke’s influence on the U.S. government, Thomas Jefferson initially listed these three natural rights in the declaration of independence before it was later revised to “live, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness”. The phrase also appears (in Locke’s formulation) in the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.  
 
379 our basic rights by protecting us from ourselves and from outside forces. This is
Locke’s social contract theory. Citizens give up their right to punish others to the
government in exchange for protection of their natural rights. In turn, governments
take on the obligation to protect our rights in exchange for sole political authority and a monopoly on the use of force.
 
Notice, however, that unlike Hobbes’ ‘covenant’, this is a social contract.
The government we have established is a party to an agreement and, as such, must
fulfill its end of the bargain. If a government fails to protect our rights (either
because it itself violates those rights or because it is negligent in enforcing them), then we have a right to refuse to fulfill our end of the obligation as well. This means
that we have no obligation to respect the authority of such a government. In fact, we
might wish to establish a new government which will protect our rights. Thus,
Locke has given the people a right to rebel against their government. It is no wonder, then, that Locke had such a profound impact on the founders of the United States;
his philosophical framework justified their right to rebel.
 
Beyond this, Locke’s philosophy also provides answers to a number of other
political issues from his own day. One of the most straightforward connections is between Locke’s account of property and the colonial project. When the English
settlers arrived in America, they looked around at the continent and saw its
inhabitants as living in a state of nature. In turn, they began to take ownership of the
natural resources and land that they encountered. Of course, this land already
belonged to the indigenous peoples living there. However, without recognizing the English hallmarks of labor (e.g., farms and fences), colonists took the Americas to
not belong to anyone and, thus, be open for the taking. For this reason, Locke’s
answer to the problem of property was a powerful tool in the hands of colonial
settlers. Modern defenders of Locke’s labor theory of property might argue that this is entirely the result of the colonists’ inability to see the labor which already existed.
Yet, the view provided a rational basis for those who were otherwise unable or
unwilling to recognize the indigenous peoples’ labor over their lands. Locke’s theory
also has something to say about women’s rights. We have already seen Judith Drake argue that Locke’s epistemology leads to regarding both genders as equal in their
intellectual abilities. It is no surprise, then, that the equality and corresponding
natural rights of all individuals in Locke's political philosophy will lead to similar
 
380 claims about women’s rights. Once again, if all people are created equal, then men
have no real authority over women, The feminist philosopher Mary Astell (another contemporary of Locke’s) argued that the conditions that women in marriages find
themselves in resemble, in the relevant respect, the state of slavery that Locke railed against. Without their natural right to control their own body, lives, and labor,
marriage denied women their natural rights. This argument is, on the one hand, an
effort to demonstrate the hypocrisy of some of Locke’s supporters who failed to
extend their analysis of natural rights to women and, on the other, a legitimate
criticism of the institution of marriage in her own time.
 
Ottobah Cugoano 
 
One thing that we have not so far addressed straight on about Locke’s
natural rights theory is the issue of slavery. On the face of it, the total equality of humans and the natural rights to life, liberty, and property that that entails also
means that slavery is an unjust violation of the rights of the enslaved. Whether or not
Locke followed his own view to its logical conclusion is another story altogether
though. On the one hand, he wrote, in general, about the evils of slavery, arguing that “slavery is so vile and miserable an estate of man… that tis hardly to be conceived
that an Englishman, much less a Gentleman, should plead for it.”119 On the other
hand, Locke was instrumental in drafting the constitution of the Carolina colonies; a
document which was explicit in securing the rights of slaveholders over their slaves.
Likewise, Locke also explicitly justified forced labor in the case of captured prisoners of a just war. It is not clear how Locke could address this seeming contradiction and,
unfortunately, America’s founders followed him in asserting both, a natural rights
account, and the supposed rights of slaveholders. However, this does not mean that
there weren’t contemporary natural rights theorists who were able to more clearly see the contradiction between the total equality of humans and the practice of slavery.
 
119 Locke, Two Treatises, 141. 
 
381
Among those arguing this case during the Early Modern period is the philosopher
Ottobah Cugoano.
 
Cugoano was born into a relatively well-connected Akan family in the town
of Ajumako on the southern coast of modern-day Ghana. However, when he was
thirteen, he was kidnapped and, along with twenty other children who happened to be playing together in a field, was brought on a slave ship to the Caribbean island of
Grenada. There, he spent the next two years working as a slave on a plantation,
before being sold to a Scottish plantation owner who brought him to England in
order to for him to live as his servant. While working as a servant, Cugoano took to educating himself to read and write. Eventually, his education drew the attention of
his enslaver, who had him formally educated before eventually freeing him. Around
this time, at the age of sixteen, Cugoano was baptized under the name ‘John Stuart’.
Eventually, he found his way into the employment of the painters Richard and Maria Cosway, whose connections introduced him to the poet William Blake and
then Prince of Wales (and eventual King) George IV. Meanwhile, Cugoano never
forgot about the countrymen and women who he had left behind in Grenada. He,
along with the freed Nigerian-born writer Olaudah Equiano, became an active member in a black abolitionist group based in the UK known as the Sons of Africa.
This group wrote frequent abolitionist letters to UK newspapers, helped in the legal
defense of enslaved people seeking legal protections, and lobbied politicians to
abolish slavery. During this time, he also wrote a narrative of his own life, entitled Thoughts and Sentiments on the Evil and Wicked Traffic of the Slavery and 
Commerce of the Human Species. Part biography, part philosophical treatise on the
injustice and immorality of slavery, the work was sent directly to prominent
politicians of the time, including then King George III and the philosopher and MP
(‘Member of Parliament’) Edmund Burke. After this, however, details of Cugoano’s life get slightly murkier. He advocated for the establishment of a colony of British
freedmen in Sierra Leone and for the educational rights of Africans living in Britain.
He also remained employed by the Cosways for at least some time. His efforts to
promote his work and the abolitionism it entailed also led him to travel widely and often in environments which were not receptive to his message. It is likely that he
died sometime during his mid-thirties.
 
382
As his baptism suggests, Cugoano was a Christian thinker, and this is
reflected in the arguments that he gives in defense of the natural rights of enslaved
people. In this case, he grounds the equality of people within a religious context; he
reminds his readers that all living humans are, according to the Bible, descended from the same group of people (the family of Noah). Accordingly, no one group is
of a higher breed than any other. However, in addition to his religious arguments,
Cugoano also elaborates on Locke’s state of nature. Where Locke had raised the issue
of natural rights in an exchange between two parties (the person whose rights are
violated and the person who violates their rights), Cugoano introduces a third-party: the onlooker. Locke has forced us to consider what each of the first two parties are
entitled to and to do in a state of nature, but what of the onlooker? Cugoano argues
that respecting the rights of others means not only avoiding theft ourselves but
helping to prevent and punish theft when we encounter it. If this is right, then average Britons, who view themselves as far-removed from the slavery their fellow
Britons engage in in the Americas, are also culpable in violations of natural rights.
While Locke does claim that we are all empowered to punish violations in the state
of nature, he does not argue that third parties have a right, much less an obligation, to ensure reparations are paid to the victim. This means that rectifying wrongs falls
on the victim who, on Locke’s model, is an equal. Cugoano’s account demonstrates
that Locke’s view will not fully remedy the wrongs of slavery in this regard. Since the
enslaved person is not equal and does not have the ability to ensure that they are repaid by the offender, they rely on third parties (even in the state of nature) to
guarantee their natural rights. This means that natural rights must be more
communal than Locke thought. Indeed, we must have obligations to preserve the
rights of others, even when we aren’t involved. The results of this are that all people are morally obligated to actively oppose all forms of slavery.
 
Beyond this, Cugoano also demonstrates the necessity of a natural rights
approach over alternative accounts of the evils of slavery. He brings up a common
argument in defense of slavery in Britain at that time; the conditions of the poor in
England and Ireland are tolerated, enslaved people in the Americas have their food and housing guaranteed in a way that the poor don’t, therefore, slavery ought to be
at least as tolerated as poverty. Cugoano points out two problems with this
argument. First, it dramatically over exaggerates the comfort and well-being of
 
383 enslaved people. In his own biography, Cugoano recalls enslaved people being
subjected to the ficklest demands of their enslavers. If an enslaved person was found
eating sugar cane while working in the cane fields, they would be either brutally
lashed or have their teeth removed. Hunger was so prevalent among the workers that many did not trust their own ability to avoid eating sugar cane. As a result, they
would either, themselves or with the help of others, pull their own teeth from their
head so that they could not eat the cane and thereby avoid punishment. It is clear
from this story that the enslaved people of the Americas had no substantive
guarantee of food and shelter. More deeply, however, Cugoano points out that even if we grant that living conditions are better for enslaved people than for the poor of
England and Ireland, no poor English or Irishman would opt for chattel slavery
instead. A larger part of the injustice of slavery isn’t just the horrible treatment that
enslaved people received, but their lack of agency. Their lives are lived at the whims of another person, who reduces their stature to that of an animal. It is the violation
of their rights, not the consequences for their lives, which is the root of the injustice
they find themselves in.120 Finally, Cugoano also points out that this argument does
not actually defend slavery. Instead, if poverty is worse than slavery and slavery is wrong, then that only gives us reason to eradicate poverty as well as slavery.
 
George Berkeley 
 
For many people in the modern world, heavily influenced by the scientific
worldview, empiricism in general and representationalism in particular seem like
intuitive, if not obvious, ways of thinking about our knowledge of the world. In
contrast, as we will see, the philosopher George Berkeley (sometimes referred to as Bishop Berkeley) attempts to distinguish the two more clearly and, in doing so,
argues that representationalism is anything but common sense. Berkeley was born in
Dysart Castle near Thomastown in the southeast of Ireland. As his being born in a
 
120 This discussion anticipates later work by philosophers like R.M. Hare, who considers whether its morally permissible for people to choose to live in slavery if remaining free meant their living in worse living conditions (Hare 1979).  
 
384 castle might suggest, Berkeley was the descendent of a long line of Anglo-Saxon
feudal landowners in Ireland. He began attending Trinity College Dublin at the age
of fifteen, where he completed a bachelor’s and master’s degree. Shortly after
completing his schooling, Berkeley was ordained in the Anglican church and began to work on issues concerning optics and the psychology of vision. This interest, in
perception, would continue on in his later philosophical career. He remained in
Ireland, working on issues of natural philosophy and rising to the rank of Dean of
Derry within the Anglican church. Feeling that Europe was in spiritual decline,
Berkeley began working on founding a seminary in Bermuda and eventually secured passage to America for himself and his new wife, Anne Forster. There, in Rhode
Island, he waited for funding for this seminary, while passing the time engaged in
intellectual life. When it became clear that the funds would not be issued, he
returned to London before being appointed Bishop of Cloyne in Ireland. In the final years of his life, Berkeley wrote his most successful work, primarily on the benefits of
drinking a mixture of water and pine tar, and helped to found a hospital in London
for orphaned children. He passed away in Oxford visiting to supervise the education
of his son.
 
For our purposes, Berkeley is best remembered as a defender of empiricism
and as a critic of representationalism. This might seem counterintuitive based on
what we have said about both positions so far. Empiricism holds that knowledge is
ultimately derived from the senses and representationalism gives us a model of how that happens. The objects of the world (e.g., tortoises, tulips, and monster trucks)
impress upon the sensory organs like a key being pressed into a bar of soap. This
impression gives us an idea of the particular objects we observed (e.g., that tortoise,
that tulip, and Grave Digger). According to Locke, we then abstract general ideas
from the common features of particular things. That is, we develop an idea of what a tortoise is by looking at different particulars and discerning what they have in
common, and we develop an idea of red by looking at particular red things in the
same way. However, Berkeley is skeptical of this story, and he raises two central
problems in order to argue his case.
 
The first issue that Berkeley takes with Locke’s picture is with his account of
abstraction. If these abstract objects (e.g., the category ‘apple’, the category ‘triangle’,
etc.) are substantive, then we must have some idea of what they are like. Locke’s
 
385 account of abstraction tells us that they are composed of the set of features that all of
the individual members of that category share; what it means to be an apple is to
have all of those features. Importantly, none of the accidental features which only
individuals have can be included in the essence of the abstract object. If some cats have spots and others don’t, then spots aren’t essential to being a cat; only what is
leftover is in the essence of the category. However, Berkeley doubts that we could
have any coherent idea of what this essence is. For instance, cats differ in size, color,
and fuzziness. Now, try to picture, in your head, a cat that is no particular size, no
particular color, and with no particular hair length. Berkeley’s argument is that this isn’t even possible to do. Rather, every time you try to picture a generic cat which
represents the entire category accurately, you fail because you picture a cat being
some particular way. If we can’t even form the idea of a universal cat, then how can
we have knowledge of that concept since knowledge would require that we have some idea which could be true. Of course, you might think the universal cat that you
picture in your mind isn’t particular; you actually did it! However, Berkeley thinks
the problem he raises is especially troubling in the case of things like triangles.
Consider that all particular triangles are either acute, obtuse, or right. Since a given triangle could be any of those (acute, obtuse, or right), and essences only contain the
features that all particulars of that kind have, being acute, obtuse, or right can’t be in
the essence of ‘triangle’. Yet, this means that when we picture the universal concept
triangle in our mind, we must picture something that is a triangle but isn’t any one particular kind. This, for Berkeley, is incoherent.
 
Beyond denying the process of abstraction and, as such, abstract objects,
Berkeley goes much further in criticizing Locke’s account. In the standard
representationalist picture, our ideas represent external objects in the world because
those objects impress upon the senses. Notice, however, that for this model to work, there must actually be some mind-independent object which can provide us with a
sense impression. Berkeley is skeptical about the existence of these kinds of objects. If
there really is, for instance, a squid which has its own independent existence away
from our perceiving it, then we should be able to say something about it apart from what we can perceive of it. Yet, what can we say about it that we didn’t learn from
observing squids through one of our many senses? We might respond that most of
what we, ourselves, know about squids comes from books and scientific studies.
 
386
However, these facts ultimately bottom out in some scientist’s observations and, if
we want to verify whether their statements are true, then we must go check for
ourselves! This forms the basis of Berkeley’s burden-shifting argument. Here, a
‘burden-shifting argument’, as a concept, refers to a general approach to arguing rather than a single particular argument. In this case, a burden-shifting argument is
one which does not prove a strong claim (in this case, that external objects don’t
exist), but instead argues that the burden is on the other side of the issue to prove
that their claim isn’t true. Berkeley thinks that, if we wanted to know, prove, or
check that a given object exists, we would simply go look. This is, for him, the commonsense view. Rather, it is the representationalist who must show that the
object exists without appealing to our senses. If he is right that this is the
commonsense view, then the burden falls on Locke and his fellow
representationalists, not Berkeley. Further, he argues, there is simply no need for mind-independent objects. When we talk about tables, snacks, and squids, we are
simply talking about sense impressions (that is, ideas in our heads). These
impressions are enough to cause our ideas and to match up with them in cases of
knowledge. If we can’t think of the imperceptible qualities of an object, prove its mind-independent existence, or even need it for knowledge, then why include it in
our theory?
 
As you might recall, Berkeley is defending a form of idealism (a view we first
encountered with Vasubandhu’s Yogācāra sub-school in ancient India). One response to his position might be to point toward your pet alligator, Tommy. When
you left for college, Tommy was a mere seven inches. Now, four years later, he is five
feet long. If he has no existence apart from your perceiving him, how was he able to
grow in the intervening time? Things were happening to him even when you weren’t
around! The same is true, the objection goes, for the changing color of tree leaves and for so many other things which grow and change even when no one is around to
observe them. Berkeley’s response to this objection is an interesting one. He says that
objects like this maintain their existence because they actually are being observed.
Everything’s existence is maintained by God, who always observes everything. This allows them to continue to grow and develop. While this might seem like a large
amount of theoretical scaffolding to us just to prove that alligators exist when we
aren’t looking at them, for Berkeley this is less of a theoretical leap than positing
 
387 some unseeable, unfeelable, unhearable things which exist forever outside of the
reach of our senses.121 
 
Émilie du Châtelet 
 
Finally, we arrive at Émilie du Châtelet. She was born into a lesser noble
family in Paris, where her early childhood was characterized by her father’s weekly
salon, at which esteemed scientists and intellectuals held court. Her father also saw to it that she received a first-class education; she met with the French Academy of
Sciences to discuss astronomy at ten, she was trained in fencing, horseback,
harpsichord, and singing, and by twelve she was fluent in Latin, Italian, Greek, and
German (in addition to her native French). Apparently her father’s efforts succeeded in this regard. In one telling incident from when she was a teenager, du Châtelet was
able to make a fair bit of money by using her mathematical prowess to develop
extremely successful gambling strategies. However, her studies were put on pause
when, at eighteen, she married the Marquis Florent-Claude du Chastellet-Lomont and the couple had three children over the next eight years. Having, in her view,
‘fulfilled her marital duties’, she made an agreement with her husband that the two
would continue to maintain a single household, but that they would otherwise live
separate lives. Here, du Châtelet picked up where she left off, by studying mathematics, this time with several highly regarded mathematicians of her day. She
also sought, and was denied, entry into one of the leading salons. Du Châtelet
responded to their sexist policy by disguising herself in men’s clothing and gaining
entrance anyways. It was during this time that she became close friends with the
controversial writer and liberal political philosopher Voltaire.122 While du Châtelet had put aside intellectual life in order to have children, Voltaire had been exiled to 
121 Idealism will become quite popular in the time after Berkeley, particularly in Germany. More can be read about this movement in the “Immanuel Kant” and “German Idealism” chapters. 
122 Though any definition of the term is controversial, here, liberalism refers broadly to the social and political position that emphasizes the freedom, rights, and equality of individuals along with rationalism about political authority. 
 
388
England due to his criticisms of the French government.123 Now, with him returned
to France and with her free to participate in scientific, philosophical, and political
discourse, the two found common cause in one another, going so far as to live
together for an extended period of time in du Châtelet’s country house. There, they collaborated on a number of works, including on mechanical philosophy,
mathematics, theology, and optics. This period eventually led to the two entering
two competing essays into a contest organized by the Paris Academy on the nature of
fire. While neither party won, both essays received honorable mention, and this
resulted in du Châtelet being the first woman to have her work published by the Academy. Shortly after this, she began an affair with the prominent French poet
Jean-François de Saint-Lambert and became pregnant. Du Châtelet died as a result of
complications after giving birth at the age of 42.
 
As we might expect, given her diverse intellectual interests, du Châtelet is remembered now for being a physicist as much as a philosopher (though it was still,
then, a branch of natural philosophy). In physics, her greatest contribution was in
resolving issues within Newton’s physics by incorporating Leibniz’s idea of kinetic
energy. Her philosophical work also follows this general pattern. She was one of few defenders of Newton in France, and she endorsed his model of mechanical
philosophy, in which nature is a unified whole which is characterized by
systematically organized smaller parts. Yet, she also agreed with Leibniz on a number
of points. For instance, she developed her own account of the principles of reason which closely resembles his and she follows him in denying atomism because
extended space must be infinitely divisible. Thus, she also adopts Leibniz’ theory of
monads. However, despite synthesizing a great many scientific and philosophical
views from both thinkers (and from Christian Wolff), she also made her own entirely
novel contributions. One of these was her defense of the use of hypotheses in science. At the time that she was writing, it had appeared that Newton and his
followers had won a debate against Cartesian physics concerning hypotheses. While
we now think of them as central to scientific practice, hypotheses had fallen out of
favor. The general view was that since physics behaved in a lawlike fashion, physicists could and should proceed by reasoning about the implications of those laws. Since
 
123 Voltaire’s political views included a support for freedom of speech, freedom of religion, separation of church and state, and the abolition of slavery. 
 
389 this model uses reason alone (as opposed to observation), we can be more certain of
the conclusions we draw. If physical laws are, indeed, lawlike, then we should have
no problem deriving true laws from established laws alone. By contrast, du Châtelet
argues that positing and testing hypotheses can increase or decrease the probability of a claim. With enough evidence, the probability that a given claim is true can be
functionally certain and, on the other hand, enough negative evidence can falsify the
view altogether. We might think that this only renders hypothesis testing as
redundant with the more certain rationalization; why bother doing this when the
same conclusions can be drawn from reason alone? Du Châtelet responds by arguing that hypotheses’ advantage is that they point us towards productive experiments. By
staking out a prediction, we are directed to find and carry out experiments which
might falsify it. This process does a better job of directing scientific inquiry. Thus,
beyond metaphysics, du Châtelet can also be thought of a central figure in the
philosophy of science. Where science itself carries out such experiments, philosophy of science is the subdiscipline of philosophy which focuses on conceptual issues in
science and on the question of how science ought to be done. In this regard, du
Châtelet’s philosophy of science is, in large part, vindicated by our current scientific practices.

The 
 
Sentimentalists 
 
If one thing has characterized our journey (and, as such, philosophy) so far,
it is the rational interrogation of the world, of oneself, and of society. Indeed,
reasoning and, subsequently, rational argument have been something of the characteristic feature of philosophy which set it apart from other kinds of
explanations and inquiry. Just as often, rationality has been seen as the good and
beautiful counterpart of our desiring emotions. This was clearly visible in Plato’s
allegory of the charioteer, where our rational soul is the driver which must keep the emotional and desiring soul in line. With the sentimentalists, emotion can finally
have its say in philosophy. Indeed, sentimentalism is the position that moral knowledge, judgements, and facts are deeply tied to our emotions. Notice, however,
that this position is entirely consistent with empiricism, which claims that experience is, directly or indirectly, the source of all knowledge. In fact, many of the
sentimentalists we will cover here are also counted as empiricists. Also like the
empiricists we have discussed, many (but not all) of the sentimentalists lived in
Britain. More specifically, as we will see, sentimentalism saw its strongest support in
Scotland when it was taken up as part of a larger intellectual movement called the Scottish Enlightenment. With the arrival of the Enlightenment and rationalism,
Scotland saw a number of figures make significant contributions to science,
philosophy, and political and economic theory. For instance, The Scottish chemist
Joseph Black is credited with discovering magnesium, specific heat, and carbon dioxide during this time period, and the Scottish naturalist James Hutton (who lived
at the same time) is often regarded as having founded modern geology. Here, we will
 
393 focus on the Scottish Enlightenment with regards to moral philosophy, philosophy
of religion, epistemology, and aesthetics along with the work of sentimentalists
outside of Scotland.
 
Before we turn to the thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment, we should
discuss the work of the person most often cited as the first sentimentalist, Anthony 
Ashley Cooper (the third Earl of Shaftesbury). If the name Anthony Ashley Cooper sounds familiar to you, it is likely because we have encountered it already in our
discussion of John Locke. You may recall that Locke was the personal physician of
an Anthony Ashley Cooper, first Earl of Shaftesbury, and would later be the personal teacher of his grandson. That grandson would later become the third Earl
of Shaftesbury, and a philosopher in his own right.
 
Shaftesbury lays the groundwork for later sentimentalists in his moral and aesthetic theories. For Shaftesbury, moral virtue consists in promoting the most
good for mankind. Careful readers will recognize this as a form of consequentialism,
or the position that consequences are what matters in determining whether an action
is good or bad. However, what is good for the human species is not, on Shaftesbury’s
account, good for its own sake. Rather, what is good is humans doing their job well and fulfilling their role within larger systems. A single person contributes to the good
of humanity, humanity contributes to the good of animal-kind, animals contribute
to the good of nature, and the natural world contributes to the good of all things.
This largest system, the system of all things, is well-designed. While the Universe may
seem chaotic and disordered, for Shaftesbury, that is only because we often fail to notice the complexity and interrelatedness of the natural world. Indeed, he spoke so
highly of the order and beauty of nature that he was instrumental in the movement
away from the neatly manicured ‘French formal gardens’ popular among European
elites, and toward the more natural ‘English landscape garden’.
 
How, then, do we achieve virtue? One very interesting, if not unique,
human ability is our capacity for ‘higher-order’ mental activity. Imagine, as unlikely
as such a scenario may be, leaving your keys at home when you go out for the day.
Your thought, that the keys are on the table, is about the keys themselves. However,
you could also have what philosophers call a higher-order thought. That is, you could think about your thought that the keys are on the table. For instance, you
 
394 might think this belief could be wrong. In the same way, we can have desires about
our desires. Shaftesbury thinks that human virtue lies in our capacity for this kind of
reflection. When we see someone in need, we desire to help. This desire is ‘first-
order’, since it is aimed at the person out in the world who needs our help. Yet, we have higher-order desires about our desires as well. Upon seeing our own desire to
help others, we like that part of ourselves and take it to be good. When we behave
immorally, seeing a wallet on the ground and taking it for ourselves, we naturally
reject this reaction. We dislike this response to seeing wallets on the ground, feel
guilty, and want to have different desires and different responses. Shaftesbury goes further still, putting forward a thesis which will be taken up by other sentimentalists
and will, in many ways, set the agenda for moral philosophy for the foreseeable
future. Here, he says that because our reactions are ‘affections’ (or desires), we can’t
reason our way out of them without having different desires. We philosophers might dream of one day seeing someone engaged in a horrible crime and stopping them
using nothing but the power of rigorous moral argumentation. It is, in many ways,
the dream implied in Socrates’ questioning of Euthyphro. If we had genuine
knowledge of morality, we could know what was moral in every case. Since we arrived at this conclusion through the use of reason, we could then reason the
immoral person into behaving morally. Shaftesbury is skeptical of this view. We can
rationalize about our desires, and we can judge some less rational than others, but a
person who feels nothing towards the suffering of others can’t be argued into caring
about them. This view, along with the rest of Shaftesbury’s account of moral 
psychology, will provide the fertile soil out of which later sentimentalists can push forward in sometimes surprising and radical new directions.
 
Francis Hutcheson 
 
The first of the Scottish sentimentalists is Francis Hutcheson. Hutcheson was born in Ireland to Scottish parents, coming from a line of Presbyterian ministers.
As a young man, he was sent to be educated at the University of Glasgow in Scotland
with plans to go into the ministry as well. However, he ultimately decided, instead,
 
395 to return to Ireland and to open an academy in Dublin. This teaching position, and
the writing he did at the time, raised his profile and allowed him to befriend
prominent church officials among the British colonists of Ireland. He was also the
first professor to lecture in English rather than Latin, and this fact allowed him to be among the most popular. During the ten years he spent at the academy in Dublin, he
also got married to his cousin Mary and, together, they had seven children (only one
of whom survived to adulthood). Eventually, Hutcheson was elevated to a position
at his alma mater, the University of Glasgow, and remained employed there until his
death sixteen years later. As we will see, this time in Glasgow was instrumental in allowing him to influence a number of students, many of whom would make
important contributions to philosophy in their own right.
 
While Shaftesbury can be credited with kickstarting sentimentalism,
Hutcheson advanced the position by synthesizing it together with the more dominant empiricism. Recall that empiricism claims that all knowledge is, directly or
indirectly, rooted in experience. In the case of Locke, we were left wondering how,
exactly, we come to have moral knowledge. After all, we don’t see the goodness of
charity or the evils of torture directly out in the world in the way that we see that a robin is red or that a mesquite tree is 25 feet tall. Perhaps, then, sentimentalism can
explain moral knowledge on an empiricist picture, and empiricism can provide us
with a framework for how sentimentalism works. In this case, Hutcheson can appeal
to the work of John Locke. Locke had argued that there are primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities (such as size) can’t be separated from the objects they are
qualities of, while secondary qualities (like color) can be. After all, the color red
might appear differently for two different people, but those same two people will
always agree about the size of an object. If your ‘three feet in length’ was someone
else’s ‘two feet in length’, you would be awfully bad at handing them things. For Locke, this meant that secondary qualities must be made in the mind; color is not
out in the world.
 
Hutcheson uses Locke’s account of primary and secondary qualities to tell
us something about value. Take, as an example, the experience of looking at a beautiful painting. When we see something beautiful, we have an immediate
reaction of pleasure to it. In one interpretation of this story, we see a painting that is
objectively beautiful out in the world and that objective beauty causes us to feel
 
396 pleasure. Notice, in this case, that beauty is, on this account, a primary quality and
the pleasure it causes is a secondary quality; the beauty is inseparable from the object
and out in the world and pleasure is something produced in the mind by the object.
Hutcheson denies this interpretation. Instead, he tells us that that secondary pleasure that we feel when we see the painting is what beauty is. After all, when someone asks
you what caused you to find the painting beautiful, you talk about its order,
symmetry, texture, and so on. That is, you point to primary qualities of the painting
which you claim caused the experience of beauty in your mind. This means that
beauty is subjective; it is in the eye (or, rather, the mind) of the beholder. Yet, there is still more we can say. Just as our ‘five senses’ allow us to notice features of the
external world and cause ideas in our mind (i.e., we notice something happening
behind us by hearing it and this perception causes us to think “something is back
there”), Hutcheson argues that we have internal senses as well. These internal senses (such as an aesthetic or moral sense) are capacities for noticing what is
happening within our minds. Shaftesbury had told us that our moral judgements are
higher-order feelings about our feelings (e.g., we like that we feel good when we help
people and we dislike the pleasure we get from stealing); Hutcheson builds off of Shaftesbury by telling us that we notice these first-order feelings using our internal
moral sense and our internal sense for beauty, which Hutcheson calls aesthetic 
taste.
 
While it may not seem revolutionary from our modern perspective to say that feeling and the emotions are central to our experiences and claims about beauty,
it was a radical departure for Hutcheson. While philosophers have talked about art
since Plato, Aristotle, Mozi, and Xunzi, aesthetics as we currently think of it (as the
philosophy of beauty and related concepts) was only just coming into its own in the
‘western tradition’. Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten, a younger contemporary of Hutcheson’s, was the first to use the word ‘aesthetics’ in this way, and his view, the
dominant aesthetic theory in continental Europe, very much resembles the
dominant views there about epistemology and metaphysics. Accordingly, this
‘aesthetic rationalism’ argued that judgements of beauty are cognitive. On this view, judging that a painting is beautiful is a matter of applying abstract principle of order
and harmony to what we perceive, in the same way that judging that we will have
four apples if we bring together two pairs of apples is just an application of our
 
397 reason to what we perceive through our senses. The consequence of aesthetic
rationalism is that what makes for good art is objective and in the world, and that we
need not feel any special way about what we are looking at in order to find it
beautiful. By contrast, Hutcheson has placed feeling and sentiment at the center of our aesthetic lives. This shift will have a profound impact on the history of
aesthetics.
 
Thinking about moral and aesthetic value in terms of internal capacities tells
us something more; just as we can train ourselves to be more careful and attentive
listeners, and baseball players can train themselves to see a ball moving through the air better, we can also train our inner senses to be better at distinguishing right from
wrong and the beautiful from the ugly. This is what moral development consists in
and, in the case of aesthetics, it is what it means to ‘refine’ our sense of taste. Notice,
though, that this training is of an innate capacity.124 Should someone lack it, we can’t educate them into having it; we can only refine what is already there. We can
improve our eye or ear, but we cannot, for instance, give ourselves echolocation. In
this way, Hutcheson follows Shaftesbury in drawing a clear and strong line between
rational education and argumentation and our senses of pleasure and pain, whether aesthetic or moral. This will continue to be a kind of calling card of sentimentalism
moving forward.
 
David Hume 
 
Of all of the sentimentalists, one stands out far above the others on account
of their impact in shaping the course of philosophy as a field, David Hume. Hume
was born as ‘David Home’ in a tenement building in Edinburgh, Scotland (he would later change the spelling of his last name to make it easier for the English to
pronounce). His father died when Hume was two and Hume’s mother was left to
 
124 Notice that this is similar to the point made by Socrates to Glaucon in Book VII of the Republic, and mirrors the debate between Mengzi and Xunzi, in ancient Chinese philosophy, over the goodness of human nature.  
 
398 provide for him, along with his brother and sister. This meant that the family’s
financial situation was tight. However, Hume was still able to obtain an education
and began attending the University of Edinburgh sometime between the age of ten
and twelve (in contrast to the more common age of fourteen). However, despite a love of learning and initial plans to study law, Hume was unable to complete a
degree at Edinburgh. He failed to see much value in lectures and, as a result, was
quite critical of the professors, preferring simply to educate himself through reading.
This self-guided study reached its high point when Hume was eighteen. He had
some sort of philosophical revelation (though he does not record it anywhere) which caused him to dedicate the next ten years exclusively to reading and writing. Some
have speculated that this breakthrough involved the work of Hutcheson, but this is
precisely that, speculation. Hume would spend the next three years endeavoring in
this project before his isolation and sedentary lifestyle began to take its toll. We are told that Hume contracted scurvy and simultaneously suffered a rather severe mental
breakdown as a result of these efforts. Consulting physicians diagnosed him with the
‘disease of the learned’ and prescribed him a regimen of bitters, ‘anti-hysteria pills’,
and a pint of wine a day. This treatment apparently worked, as it permitted him to keep reading and writing until he inexplicably developed an insatiable appetite
(especially for wine and cheese), a reputation for which would follow him
throughout his life.
 
Not being a person of means, nor having a degree or any specific training in the trades, at 25 Hume became an assistant to a merchant, which compelled him to
leave Scotland for France. While in France, Hume completed and anonymously
published his three-volume work, A Treatise of Human Nature. The work was
widely panned by scholarly critics and the reaction led Hume himself to declare that
it “fell dead-born from the press”.125 However, he continued writing and publishing until he eventually came up for consideration for a position teaching philosophy at
the University of Edinburgh. Unfortunately, by this point, Hume’s writings had
earned him a reputation (whether fair or unfair) for atheism. While scholars still
debate the extent to which Hume was an atheist, this reputation alone was enough to lose him the job as a professor. Yet, he still managed to secure a role at the same
 
125 David Hume, My Own Life, 1777. https://davidhume.org/texts/mol/. 
 
399 institution as a librarian, which allowed him to continue writing and researching.
Suspecting that it was his writing and not his ideas that led readers away from the
Treatise, Hume attempted to edit and repackage the work, this time publishing it as
An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding and An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals. Having made great strides to recuperate his wounded
reputation, Hume tried once more to secure a professorship in philosophy, now at
the University of Glasgow. Despite the success of his subsequent works, his
reputation as an atheist prevented this from coming to fruition as well. This did
nothing to stop Hume from writing critically about religion, as he completed two works on the topic which a worried friend eventually convinced him not to publish
until after his death. Finally, in one last attempt to cement himself as an intellectual
in the public eye, Hume used his access to the library at the University of Edinburgh
to write and publish a history of England. This work, titled (straightforwardly enough) The History of England, fulfilled Hume’s ambitions and became both a
bestseller and the go-to text on English history for the next half-century. Hume was
able to parlay this success into a position as the secretary of the Earl of Hertford at
the English embassy in Paris. Hume used his position to secure Jean-Jacque Rousseau (who had been forced to flee from Switzerland) protection in England.
Eventually, Hume ended up back in Edinburgh where he lived until the age of 65,
dying from abdominal cancer.
 
Like many of the philosophers we have already discussed (including Descartes and Locke), Hume is a representationalist. Also like Locke, Hume is an
empiricist. Together, this means that our concepts and beliefs represent the world
and, by accurately representing it, we can come to knowledge. Hume argues that this
model gives us an exhaustive picture of our own thoughts; there are only impressions
and ideas. Objects out in the world create an impression on the senses. To use a now familiar analogy, these objects act like a key being pressed into a bar of soap, leaving
behind an impression. These impressions, left on the sensory organ (e.g., eye, ear,
hand, etc.) are then ‘copied’ by the mind as ideas. Your idea of a lobster is of a lobster
because it was copied from your impression of a lobster, which is of a lobster because that lobster was impressed upon your senses when you saw it. Hume, being the good
empiricist that he is, believes that all ideas are derived from experience in this way.
However, ideas can form from these impressions in one of two ways. First, we can
 
400 have an idea on the basis of our memory. So-and-so saw a pineapple upside-down
cake at their fifteenth birthday party and now, at the age of 59, they can recall the
sense impression it left and form the idea of a pineapple upside-down cake in their
mind. The other way that ideas can form is through the imagination. Our imagination can break down and synthesize together different sense impressions. For
instance, we can take the impression of a horse and the impression of a narwhal and
form the idea of a unicorn by imagining a creature with different features from both
impressions. In the same way, we can form the idea of the color orange from an
impression of a mango by stripping away the other features and leaving only the color. Hume breaks this picture down further still, saying that the imagination can
operate ‘from fancy’ or ‘from understanding’. The unicorn example above is, as you
might expect, an exercise of the imagination working from fancy. By contrast, ideas
formed through the imagination from understanding are more reasonable. Here, Hume introduces his final distinction, between ‘relations of ideas’ and ‘matters of
fact’. All of our true beliefs are formed in one of these two ways.
 
With regards to the first category, relations of ideas, Hume tells us that
these are ideas we form on the basis of reason alone. When we come to believe that the square root of sixteen is four, we don’t need to go out into the world and observe
anything, we can figure this out entirely within our own head by simply thinking
clearly about what our concepts of ‘four’, ‘sixteen’, and ‘square root’ mean. By
contrast, matters of fact require that we have some direct experience in order to come to know them. If we wanted to know how many European starlings are in our
yard at any given time, we are forced to go out and check. Notice, Hume says, that
relations of ideas are necessarily true; we can observe as much as we want, but the
truth of four being the square root of sixteen won’t change, that’s why we don’t
need to go outside to know it. On the other hand, the number of European starlings in our yard at any given time is contingent; it depends on how many birds there
actually are outside. In this way, matters of fact are not necessarily true and require
some basis in observation. While this picture is easy enough to understand (and,
perhaps, intuitive), Hume can use these basic pieces to arrive at some pretty astounding conclusions about causation and the self.
 
401
Hume’s account of mental perceptions 

 
First, Hume points out what you may have already noticed; mathematical
truths are relations of ideas and scientific knowledge is a matter of fact. However,
this means that scientific knowledge lacks the certainty we see in math. Things as basic and predictable as the sun rising tomorrow are only contingently true, and we
can say that it will necessarily happen. Of course, we might reasonably expect it to
happen because it has happened so many times in the past, but we can never truly be
certain. Indeed, many of our beliefs about matters of fact (and all of science) is, in
some way, built upon this kind of thinking. Philosophers call it inductive reasoning. We observe things out in the world for a while and, on the basis of this
sample, form general statements about the way things are. Over the course of your
life, you see hundreds of white swans and no black ones and, accordingly, you form the belief that all swans are black.  However, this is still a matter of fact. Since it is not
a relation of ideas and, therefore, not necessarily true, the belief is not proven but
only not disproven. It only takes one black swan to falsify your generalization and, as
such, induction presents us with a weaker form of reasoning than deduction.
Deductive reasoning, by contrast, is the kind we have seen in math and formal logic so far, and Hume would call this kind of thinking the relation of ideas.
 
402
You might respond by saying that you can be certain that the sun will rise
tomorrow, and that induction does give us certain knowledge. After all, you say, it
was the basis for your thinking that the sun would rise today, and that belief was
proven true. In fact, the system of inductive reasoning seems to be vindicated every day when the sun rises. Hume anticipates this objection and points out that this
argument is, in fact, circular. What we have said is that generalizing from past
observation works because generalizing from past observation has worked in the
past. Notice, though, that this is itself an inductive generalization. Just because
induction has worked in the past, it does not mean that it will continue to work. The position we now find ourselves in is certainly a frustrating one; all generalization and
all scientific knowledge are left irrevocably uncertain. No matter how good our
scientific instruments get, genuinely certain knowledge about matters of fact will
always escape us. With that, Hume seems to have doomed Descartes’ dream of a firm and certain foundation upon which all knowledge can rest. He has split the whole of
understanding into two and, in doing so, kept us from ever finding firm footing for
the entire body of our beliefs.
 
Hume’s criticisms of matters of fact run deeper still. Beyond generalizing from a small observed sample to the general population and from the past to the
future, science hopes to give us the ability to learn about natural laws. When
Newton declared that what goes up must come down, he meant it must; gravity is a
law, not a recommendation or advice to plan around. However, Hume’s claim that matters of fact are necessarily uncertain means that scientific laws are necessarily
uncertain. Even the law of cause and effect is unable to evade his scrutiny. That
gravity causes a ball thrown away from the Earth to come back down towards it is an
imposition of our minds. Instead, Hume challenges us to look closely at an instance
of causation. Take, for example, a game of pool. When the cue ball strikes the eight-ball, we are quick to say that it causes the eight-ball to move. Yet, if we were to slow
this action down all the way to a frame-by-frame analysis, we would see no such
cause. Instead, we see the eight-ball motionless through a series of frames while the
cue ball slowly creeps towards it. At the point of contact, the cue ball simply stops moving and the next sequence of frames has the eight-ball moving away. Nowhere,
Hume says, do we see any ‘causal forces’; we just see two balls, one in motion and
then the other. Without an impression of the causation happening, there is nothing
 
403 for our idea of causation to copy and represent. Thus, scientific laws are, for Hume,
more like rules of thumb than strictly necessary facts. Thus, where scientists are
prone to say that correlation is not causation, Hume would have us think that
causation is nothing more than the attribution of highly elaborate and specific correlations. Because balls so often come down when thrown in the air, and we rely
so much on the ‘constant conjunction’ of the ball being thrown and falling down,
we say that gravity causes it, but this is only a habit (albeit one that Hume thinks
isn’t too harmful and is difficult to avoid). The same applies to all other cases of
caution in science and in our everyday life; that smoking causes cancer, that germs cause disease, and that antibiotics cause the end of a bacterial infection. None of this
is certain and none of it is more than a convenient habit of describing the apparent
regularity of the world.126 
 
Having already thrown out scientific certainty, causal laws, and our knowing beyond a reasonable doubt that the sun will rise tomorrow, Hume now
turns his gaze towards the self. Since all ideas point toward impressions which
represent the world, if our idea of the self is correct (and therefore knowledge), it too
must point at some impression. We should, then, be able to observe the self. Yet, if we have some enduring self (whether that is an immortal soul or not), Hume fails to
find it in observation. Descartes had claimed that he knew for certain that he existed
and had a self because he observed himself thinking. In response, Hume claims that
our thoughts are either about objects which have left an impression upon us or about the ideas we formed on this basis. If this is right, then when Descartes claimed
to know that he existed as an observer, he claimed to have observed this observer.
Hume is skeptical that anyone could do any such thing. For one thing, what did this
mental self look like? If we had an impression of it, then we should be able to talk
about that impression in the same way that we do other impressions. Further still, if we did observe that observer, it only raises the further question of who observed the
observer’s observer and how. Instead of thinking of the mind as a theater with an
immaterial observer in the audience (perhaps with their own internal theater in their
mind and so on), Hume tells us the mind is more like an open stage with no audience. It is, rather, the site of our ideas and impressions, which dance across the
 
126 You may recognize that Hume’s view about the problem of causation, and his argument for that view, is very similar to al-Ghazali’s.  
 
404 stage performing their own part before exiting. There is, in Hume's view, no
underlying narrative to this activity and no continuous observer watching it. It is,
much like the play Cats, just character after character presenting themselves in a
succession to an empty theater. Thus, like our claims about causation, our claims about the self don’t point toward anything real and substantive and are, strictly
speaking, not true, and only made out of habit. The real self, the thing we do have, is
just a ‘bundle of perceptions’.127 Accordingly, we can call this the bundle theory of 
the self.
 
So far, Hume has used his simple picture of ideas and impressions to argue for a number of fairly radical skeptical conclusions about the self, causation,
scientific knowledge, and natural laws. While he did tell us that coming to be
skeptical of these things at an intellectual level is unlikely to affect our behavior,
because the habit of acting as if these things were certain is so ingrained in us, one can’t help but wonder whether all this skepticism will make us less likely to engage in
moral behavior. If no one has a self, who is there to need help and who is there to feel
bad for not helping others. If we can’t actually cause the world to be a better or
worse place, then why bother trying in the first place? These are exactly the kinds of
concerns raised by Anna Julia Cooper.128 She was born into slavery in North Carolina shortly before the American Civil War but managed to secure the level of education normally reserved for boys. She continued this education, earning a
bachelor’s and master’s degree from Oberlin College along with a doctorate from the University of Paris, eventually becoming the President of Frelinghuysen University
in Washington D.C. and spending a lifetime working tirelessly as an advocate for
women’s rights and for racial equality. In her most famous work, A Voice from the 
South By a Black Woman of the South, Cooper criticizes Hume and fellow skeptics
of the early modern period (such as Voltaire), saying that the skeptical attitude they endorse does not allow for the development of traits like heroism, devotion, or
sacrifice. Yet, Hume does still have something to say about morality. Whether these
 
127 Notice the similarities between Hume’s answer to the problem of personal identity and the Buddhist doctrine of anattā.
128 Cooper’s work is also discussed in the “The Pragmatists” chapter. 
 
405 views, when taken together, can motivate us to engage in ethical behavior is left as an
exercise for the reader.
 
With his moral theory, Hume introduces what has come to be called the 
fact/value distinction (also referred to as the ‘is/ought distinction’). That is,
between the way the world is and the way it ought to be. To illustrate, imagine coming upon the cruel scene of an adult picking on a small child. Being a fully and
morally developed person, you tell them to stop and to try picking on someone their
own size for a change. In turn, they ask you why they ought to do that instead of
doing what they love, picking on children. You might respond by saying that they are clearly violating the child’s rights to go about their daily life unbothered, or that they
are causing the child a great deal of suffering, or that picking on children is mean and
therefore unfit for a virtuous person. However, they respond once again by asking
why they should respect the child’s rights, why they should care about their suffering, or why they should want to be virtuous in the first place. This person, as
nasty as they may be, has clearly read their Hume. He tells us that any attempt to
argue for a normative claim (that is, a claim about what we ought to do) requires at
least one normative premise. We can say that picking on a child causes unnecessary suffering, and we ought not cause unnecessary suffering, therefore we ought not
pick on children. However, in order for this argument to work, and convince the
person we are arguing against, they must already accept that we ought not cause
unnecessary suffering. Notice that this means that reason alone cannot compel us to behave morally, we must already accept some prior value. Yet, as we mentioned at
the start of the chapter, philosophers have long hoped to have some way of showing
that rational reflection could compel goodness and virtue in people necessarily.
Instead, there is no way to derive an ‘ought’ from an ‘is’ and, as such, reason stands
no chance of telling us what we should value (at least on its own). This problem, of how we can justify morality without appealing to moral value, is now called the
is/ought problem.
 
Hume makes a similar point about our moral psychology as well. We can
judge it reasonable to think that we must practice in order to make it to the NBA. Likewise, we may think it makes sense to pay our taxes if we want to avoid going to
jail. However, as evidenced by the large numbers of people not currently playing
basketball or paying their taxes, these judgments are not enough to motivate us to do
 
406 these things. Instead, we need to want to be in the NBA in order for our belief that
practice is necessary to achieve that goal to motivate us to actually practice. The same
is true of paying our taxes. If we are fine going to jail, the fact that paying our taxes
will keep us out of jail does little to compel us to do it. Thus, not only is the fact/value distinction a problem for philosophers like us, who hope to one day save
someone using only our argumentative skill; it is a problem for action. This tells us
that living a normal human life, acting and doing things for reasons, is ultimately a
project done under the supervision of our desires. This inverts Plato’s allegory of the
charioteer, in which the desiring or appetitive soul is the workhorse of the rational soul which drives us towards the good. Instead, Hume claims that “reason is, and
ought only to be the slave to the passions.”129 Unfortunately, if this is right, then all
the philosophical training and insight in the world will do little to improve the life or
character of someone who simply lacks moral values.
 
If you are left wondering, now, where these values come from in the first
place, you are in luck. Hume has a story to tell us about our moral psychological
development as well. On his view, our inner moral sense is, as Hutcheson argued, an
innate sensory capacity. Humans are born into family units and, as a result, rely on their family for their survival. If what is good for the mother is good for the child,
then the child will feel pleasure in the mother’s victories and sorrow in her defeats.
As the child grows up, they begin to feel romantic attraction to other people. By
negotiating their dating life, they are further instructed in the ways in which our happinesses are interrelated. Throughout this entire process, they reflect on
responses and begin to understand the logic which moves them. We value the
happiness of others because it contributes to our own happiness. However, what
about those that we don’t rely on? For instance, the village on the other side of the
hill? Do we have any reason to care about their happiness at all, or should we simply plunder their town in order to bolster the happiness of ourselves and our own
family? After all, resources are scarce and they won’t give them to us voluntarily.130 
 
129 Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, 2003. https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4705/pg4705-images.html. 130 These concerns, that there are scarce resources and people disagree about how to use them, Hume calls the ‘circumstances of justice’. We saw this concept already in the work of the 
407
Hume claims that this predicament, reminiscent of Hobbes’ state of nature, is a
tricky one to get out of. We need some reason for respecting the rights and property
of others even when we don’t care about them. However, unlike Hobbes and Locke,
Hume does not think that property is a natural right, but a civil one. Initially, we simply declare that we intend to enforce our own claim on our family’s belongings as
a deterrent for others. In doing so, we tell them to expect a fight if they try to take
things from inside the hut but not if they take what is in the field. The others, being
rationally self-interested, plan accordingly, and prioritize taking from the common
goods first. Having seen this effect on their behavior, they take up the practice of claiming property rights as well. Eventually, the benefits of this system are so great
that people in the community begin making property rights formal and enforceable.
With all of our newfound security and prosperity, we can set about doing more and
more productive tasks and trading for different goods (instead of spending our time tracking down our stolen objects, engaged in armed conflict, and cleaning up the
blood from our many battles). Importantly, in this picture, property rights do not
emerge until there is a need for them. If property rights were natural, then we would
have had them before we even knew of other families or other tribes. Critical of this, Hume points out that property evolves as a solution to a civil problem (that is, one
of us living and working together). This rationally self-interested concern for our
own happiness (and that of our families) leads us to accept property rights, and
property rights encourage us to cooperate socially.131 
 
If this picture is how we develop our moral sense, we still must discuss the
development of that other value detection system, our aesthetic sense. To start with,
Hume follows Hutcheson in claiming that beauty is the pleasure we feel at sensing
an object, and that our sense of aesthetic taste is an internal capacity. Accordingly,
like Hutcheson, this means that beauty is subjective, but that taste can be refined. Notice, though, that those who argue that beauty is objective often claim that what
is objectively beautiful is what they, with their refined tastes, like. By contrast,
 
legalist philosopher Han Fei. In turn, we will encounter it again when discussing the philosopher John Rawls in the “Political and Social Philosophy” chapter. 131 This grounding of goodwill and social cooperation in property rights and rational self-interest will be further developed by Adam Smith, who will be discussed in the next section of the chapter. 
 
408
Hume’s model allows that some people have more refined taste than others, but it
raises an immediate question about aesthetic value: if beauty is subjective, why
should we care about refining our sense of taste? Perhaps it is true that the more
music appreciation classes we take, the more we will prefer Mozart to Taylor Swift, but this never seems to matter at all when it comes to debates between Mozart and
Taylor Swift fans about whose work is more beautiful; there simply is no fact of the
matter. Hume tries to navigate this narrow space very carefully. While aesthetic
judgments can’t be true or false, they can be better or worse. To make sense of this,
imagine comparing two desserts; some sugar cookies made by a decent amateur baker and a chocolate soufflé made by a true master of their craft. Hume thinks that
everyone, whether they have refined taste or not, is likely to feel pleasure (that is,
beauty) when tasting the cookies. The things we like about good sugar cookies (e.g.,
the sweetness, warmth, texture, etc.) are sufficient to cause us to feel pleasure. However, getting more pleasure from the expert’s work often requires an ability to
see how much more skill the expert has. Someone with experience in or knowledge
about baking (that is, with more refined tastes) knows it is more difficult to make a
soufflé than it is to make sugar cookies and they know why that is. This knowledge allows them a rich intellectual appreciation of the soufflé that isn’t available to a less
knowledgeable judge, and which isn’t available in eating sugar cookies. This extra
enjoyment makes their judgment about the soufflé better than the uninformed
critic’s judgment about the sugar cookies; there is simply more different kinds of pleasure to be had.
 
What kinds of knowledge do ideal critics have? For Hume critics should
have a strong aesthetic sense, capable of discerning fine-grained differences between
works, which they would have improved through practice of comparing hundreds of
works to one another, and their judgements should be totally free of any prejudices. This last part, about being free of prejudices, philosophers refer to as
disinterestedness.132 Since the critic is evaluating a work based on its beauty, they
shouldn't be influenced by other kinds of concerns (like whether they like the artist
 
132 The German philosopher Immanuel Kant was another strong believer in the importance of disinterestedness in art appreciation (and his work is actually where the word originates). More can be read about Kant, his account of disinterestedness, and his larger aesthetic theory in the “Immanuel Kant chapter”.  
 
409 as a person, whether the artist’s country beat their own country in the Olympics, or
whether the work itself espouses political views they disagree with). As you can see,
to think that art appreciation should be disinterested goes hand in hand with
aesthetic autonomism, or the view that aesthetic values and moral values are distinct.
 
Finally, we arrive at those views which got Hume in the most trouble during his lifetime, his work in philosophy of religion. First, we turn to his exploration of
the problem of evil.133 As a reminder, this is the question of how we can reconcile a
perfect god with all of the suffering we see in the world. If God wants to help those
who suffer but can’t, then he omnipotent (all powerful); if he doesn’t want to help then he isn’t omnibenevolent (perfectly moral); if he has the power and desire to
help but is simply unaware of our suffering then he isn’t omniscient (all knowing).
Yet, many believe (and have argued) that God is necessarily all of these things. As we
have already seen, a popular response to this problem is to appeal to our free-will. God, in his infinite wisdom, gave us free-will which we can use for better or for
worse, and for him to intervene to stop a murder now would be to deny the
murderer free-will. However, even if this is true, it brings us no closer to
understanding why God allows all kinds of ‘natural evil’. Hurricanes and disease kill hundreds of thousands of children a year and surely we don’t think that this is
because God gave hurricanes and malaria free-will. Another popular response that
we have seen is that the evil we seem to see is no evil at all. The suffering we
experience in life is a necessary part of a larger scheme which God has orchestrated, and which is so great that all of our suffering is merely a drop in the bucket. While
we may think that a particular tornado existing just meant a bunch of unnecessary
suffering, God is able to know that, if he were to remove that tornado from existence
prior to it happening, there would be ripple-effects resulting in even more suffering.
As Leibniz would say, we live in the best of all possible worlds, even if we can’t see that from our limited point of view. Hume has a response to this. Notice that this
story means that we are simply not qualified to make moral judgements at all. While
things look like evils and suffering to us, the truth is that they really aren’t. However,
if we aren’t able to properly judge whether something is evil or not, then what reason do we have for thinking that God is morally perfect in the first place? Whatever
 
133 As you might recall, this is one of the oldest problems in philosophy, having been first recorded by Saggil-kīnam-ubbib around 1,000 B.C.E. 
 
410 evidence we provide for God’s goodness, it is subject to the same limited standpoint
that our evidence of suffering is. Notice, however, that this does not necessarily
prove that God doesn’t exist, nor does it prove that God isn’t perfectly moral. We
can still avoid the problem of evil altogether by just having a different account of God (that is, not claiming that God is all powerful, all good, and all knowing). Once
we limit any one of the attributes to any degree, the problem of evil dissolves.
Likewise, it may be true that God is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent,
but Hume’s argument is a burden-shifting one; it argues that God’s existence is
compatible with the existence of evil and that it is the burden of the believer to show us how we can know that God is perfect in all these ways.
 
Next, Hume turns to the existence of miracles.  Hume points out that
religious miracles are unusual events. After all, if they happened every day and we
had to plan around them, then they really wouldn’t be all that miraculous. What makes the Christian claim that Jesus rose from the dead a claim about a miracle
happening is that people don’t generally rise from the dead; what makes it
exceptional that Jesus is claimed to have walked on water is that the rest of us can’t.
Indeed, if our friend Carl were to figure out that Jesus actually just had some really cool shoes that made this feat possible, and then make a pair for himself, we would
probably think it wasn’t a miracle after all. Instead, it would just be that Jesus was
really ahead of his time as a scientist and fashion designer. What makes a miracle a
miracle, then, is that it represents a deviation from our normal natural laws. If Carl finds out how to replicate what Jesus is claimed to have done, he did not perform the
miracle that Jesus did; it is a miracle when Jesus does it because he does it with no
natural way of it working out. Indeed, the point of miracles is often that by
performing them the miracle worker can demonstrate that they have a connection or
power above and beyond our normal natural laws.
 
This may seem straightforward enough to you, but Hume claims that it has
an important implication. First, Hume points out that, in our reasoning between
competing claims, we can only weigh the evidence in favor of both claims and go
with what has more evidence in its favor. If we are trying to decide whether a particularly large beaver is capable of advanced mathematics, we must look at
evidence on both sides. The case for the claim is that our old friend Carl says he saw
the beaver attempting to prove the Navier-Stokes equation in the kitchen the other
 
411 day. On the other hand, our current understanding of rodent biology tells us that
beavers don’t have the manual dexterity nor the higher cognitive functioning
necessary for the task. While Carl says he saw it, his word is weighed against the
combined observations of everyone (including many scientists) who have observed the kinds of things that beavers are capable of over many hundreds of years. Surely,
the evidence is in favor of Carl simply not seeing things in the kitchen quite right.
 
Now, we can attempt to weigh the evidence in favor of any given miracle
happening in the same way. Unfortunately, Hume argues, all of the religious
miracles people claim to have witnessed are in the same boat as Carl’s claims of a mathematically capable beaver. If what makes a miracle miraculous is that it departs
from the laws of nature, then each claim of a miracle happening must go up against
all of the evidence that made us think that that was a law of nature in the first place,
and a miracle can never come out on top. This means that a miracle happening is necessarily the less reasonable explanation of events, and we are never justified in
believing in them.
 
Importantly, what Hume tells us about miracles rubs up against another of
Hume’s claims, this time about laws of nature. He already told us that we have no basis for thinking that natural laws are any more special or significant than long
standing patterns of correlation. What’s more, we can never know for certain, since a
violation of a natural law is a matter of fact, that that violation is necessarily
impossible; this was Hume’s whole point about the sun not rising tomorrow (which
would, itself, be rather miraculous). Thus, while Hume can say that we are never reasonably justified in believing in a miracle, he still can’t tell us for certain that they
aren’t possible. However, his position is still a strong one. Many people come to
believe in God or a particular religion on the basis of some miracle happening. The
problem is that, if we are never justified in believing in miracles (whether they are possible or not), we can’t hold the belief that the miracle happened and use it as
evidence for God’s existence or the claims of a particular religion.
 
412
Adam Smith 
 
While David Hume might have been the sentimentalist with the greatest
impact on the history of philosophy, it is another figure who can (perhaps) be
credited with the greatest impact on the world, Adam Smith. Smith was born in
Kirkcaldy, on Scotland's east coast. While Smith’s father (a prominent lawyer) died
before Smith was born, his mother was left with enough resources to provide for herself and her infant child. Little is known about Smith’s early life, including his
birthday, other than that he was (for a brief period) kidnapped at the age of three
before being rescued and returned to his mother. At fourteen, Smith enrolled at the
University of Glasgow, and it was then that he became a student of Hutcheson’s. After staying at Glasgow for a while, Smith ended up moving to Oxford University,
where he found the intellectual climate quite stifling. In his personal
correspondence, complained about the quality of his education, especially in
comparison to what he received in Glasgow. The conflict between Smith’s Oxford education and his preference for the Scottish sentimentalists culminated in an event
where a professor caught him reading the works of Hume; for this, the book was
confiscated and Smith was harshly punished. Between these struggles and his own
mental health issues, Smith left Oxford shortly after without completing his degree.
 
Upon leaving Oxford, Smith secured a professorship at the University of
Edinburgh where he was finally able to meet one of his two great intellectual heroes
(with the other being Francis Hutcheson): David Hume. The two shared a close
friendship during Smith’s tenure at Edinburgh, and Smith quickly set out lecturing
on logic, rhetoric, and political economy (or the study of how governments regulate economic activity). He also published his first major work, The Theory of 
Moral Sentiments, which turned out to be a great success. While students from
around the world left their universities and transferred to the University of Glasgow
to study under Smith, it wasn’t long before he received an offer to leave the university in order to work as the private tutor of the stepson of a prominent British
politician. While this would mean traveling with the father and son as they engaged
in diplomatic affairs, it also meant that Smith could be introduced into political life
and, hopefully, rise its ranks. While in France (and, later, Switzerland), Smith met and befriended the philosopher Voltaire and the American politician Benjamin
 
413
Franklin. When his time as a tutor came to an end, Smith made his way home to
Scotland where he published his most successful book, The Wealth of Nations, and
took a job as the commissioner of customs. Smith would remain in Scotland until his
death.
 
In contrast to Hume, who builds his moral theory on the basis of happiness, Smith’s moral psychological framework is founded, principally, on sympathy.
‘Sympathy’, here, refers to our ability to imagine what it would feel like to be in
another person’s position. Importantly, this differs from empathy, in which
someone’s actual feelings spread to those around them (e.g., when you feel pain at having seen the pain of someone else, etc.). While Hume held that we are most
fundamentally interested in our own happiness but come to have an interest in
others due to our mutual dependency, Smith claims that humans naturally
sympathize for its own sake; we want to share in the feelings of others. This drive for connection, through our powers of sympathy, is then a fact of human nature. In
turn, it is a fact of sympathy that to sympathize is to approve of that person’s feelings
as appropriate. When someone complains about their situation, but we don't
actually think it is that bad, we don’t tend to feel sympathy towards them. Thus, our sympathetic tendencies can tell us a lot about our moral commitments; we feel
outrage on behalf of victims when they are treated cruelly, we feel pride in watching
our child help others, and we feel sad when our friends are suffering.
 
Yet, despite its attractions, sympathy also has its issues. Most importantly,
our sense of sympathy can be biased; people tend to feel more sympathy for people they know, people who look like them, and attractive people. In reality, we often fail
to properly sympathize with others because it is politically expedient, or because we
don’t want to give up our own money to help them, even when they might need it
more. Smith’s solution to this is to say that morality consists not in what we actually sympathize with, but in what an impartial third-party would sympathize with. He
calls this person the impartial spectator. Notice that Smith’s account has us
critically evaluate our own behavior and the behaviors of others in the same way that
Hume would have us evaluate art, from a totally disinterested perspective. However, Smith is not naive; he knows that even when we try to occupy a disinterested third-
party point of view, we are often still biased in various ways. There are real limits to
how much of another person’s experience we can truly imagine. For this reason,
 
414
Smith is skeptical that a moral theory can give us very much. Where Plato thought
that a good society comes from each person sorting themselves out internally and
acting right, Smith thinks that each person in society being moral in this way is
neither necessary nor sufficient to make a just society. Instead, the best way to ensure social cooperation is in the marketplace.
 
In order to understand Smith's work on political economy, we should first
understand the dominant view of his time. When Smith is writing, Europe and its
colonies primarily operate according to a system called ‘mercantilism’. This is the
view that societies ought to accumulate wealth in the form of money, goods, and resources. On the basis of this view, many people advocated for restricting trade.
After all, if (for example) Britain buys goods from the United States, then the United
States has turned a profit, increasing the relative wealth of the U.S. in comparison to
Britain. Instead, if Britain were to buy only British goods, then the money the country would have sent to America stays within Britain's borders where it can
accumulate. Smith argues against this view. To understand how, let’s consider a
much smaller example. If it is good for Britain to buy only British goods in order to
save money, then we should expect the same to be true for a particular family. If our family wants to be wealthy, then it shouldn’t send all its money off as profits to
stores. We could, in fact, become ‘protectionists’ at home, making all of our own
furniture and electronic goods, and growing all of our own food. The problem is
that stores, by specializing in what they sell, can bring the cost of doing this down. While it would actually be quite expensive for a family to buy up metal and
equipment to manufacture computer parts, a computer company can buy these
things in bulk, reducing the overall cost of doing so. Perhaps more importantly, it
would take a long time for a family of five to make everything they want to live a
comfortable modern life. In fact, the time they spent planting crops and smithing metal could have been used working and making more money. If the family focused
on one item, say tomatoes, they could efficiently and cheaply make them and trade
with a family doing the same thing with computers and so on. What this shows us is
that we are all better off under a division of labor, in which different people do different jobs. The same is true, on Smith’s account, for countries. It’s okay that the
United States profits off the sale of some items to Britain, Britain will simply profit
off the sale of other goods to the U.S. or to other countries. In the end, it is labor that
 
415 is more important than goods, and by dividing up our labor and trading, we free
ourselves up to do more productive, more useful labor.
 
We should notice something about Smith’s story here; everyone involved in
this exchange of goods benefited, each party cooperated with one another, and no
one did so out of the kindness of their heart. Instead, this great system of productivity and cooperation rests simply on their natural self-interest. As Smith
famously says in The Wealth of Nations, “it is not from the benevolence of the
butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our inner, but from their regard for
their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-
love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages.”134 Each
family wants to become as wealthy as possible and it just so happens that the best
way of doing that is to produce goods for, and thereby increase the resources of,
other families. This is the way in which Smith’s views about political economy do not rest on his moral theories about individuals. Productive and helpful people in
the marketplace do not need to have unbiased sympathy, they only need the profit
motive. In turn, the structure of the marketplace will guide all of these individual
actors towards the best possible results for everyone. Smith famously refers to this
tendency as the ‘invisible hand’ of the market; it is as if they were all following orders to work towards the best possible situation, even if no one is actually in
charge.
 
Yet, while Smith was a prominent believer in the transformative power of
markets, this does not mean that we should always let the market do whatever it wants. At the time that Smith is writing, other theorists of political economy, in
France, have put forward such a theory. François Quesnay and Jacques Claude 
Marie Vincent de Gournay, having been influenced by the Daoist concept of wu-
wei and the political philosophy that the ancient Chinese Daoists derived from it,
had developed their own theory of laissez-faire (or ‘let do’). This model, and the physiocrat school that defended it, argued that the economy is like nature, and that
like nature it behaved according to well-designed natural laws. In the same way that
Shaftesbury preferred the chaotic order of the English landscape garden to the imposed order of the French formal garden, the physiocrats preferred the natural
 
134 Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, Books I-III (London: Penguin Classics, 1982): 13. 
 
416 order of the market over the imposition of the government to decide the way in
which the economy ought to grow. While this is Smith’s general orientation, he does
not think we ought to be completely hands off with the economy. For instance,
imagine someone buying up a great deal of land and not developing anything on it. Instead, they merely wish to create scarcity in the economy; the more land they have,
the less there is to go around, and the more their land is worth. Unfortunately, this
person has increased their own wealth without actually creating anything of value;
the land remains exactly the same as it was. Modern economists call this
phenomenon ‘rent-seeking’, and Smith argued that this kind of circumstance is one in which the state is justified in acting. Since it is not the natural beauty of the market
that makes the market good for Smith, it is the market’s ability to allow for more
productive labor (which it does in most cases), the market must answer to that
productivity. The rent-seeker does not use the land in a productive way, and for Smith, the State could tax or otherwise confiscate the land through eminent domain
in order to encourage its development. In this way, while Smith agrees with the
Physiocrats that there are distinct natural laws governing the economy, this fact
doesn’t give us any reason not to intervene in principle any more than the fact that there are laws of physics means that we should engage in engineering projects.
Instead, the existence of distinct economic laws merely means that we should
develop a domain of inquiry like we have in physics, in order to study them so that
we can better and more carefully engineer our social projects. We now call this field of research ‘economics’, and Smith is often credited as the ‘father of modern
economics’, and Smith thinks (at the very least) that careful study of economics
teaches us to have a healthy skepticism about our ability to outperform the market
and a healthy respect for how much the market actually can accomplish.
 
Sophie de Grouchy 
 
Just as Margaret Cavendish and Anne Conway raise problems for a neat
distinction between ‘Continental rationalists’ and ‘British empiricists’ on account of
their being British, Sophie de Grouchy (also known as Madame Sophie de
 
417
Condorcet) complicates any attempt to identify early modern sentimentalism as an
entirely Scottish phenomenon. Grouchy was born outside of Paris, in Meulan, to an
aristocratic family. The Grouchy’s were always close to power, whether that was
political or martial. For instance, her father worked for King Louis XV as a page and her brother was a cavalry commander under Napoleon, eventually being blamed for
the French loss at the Battle of Waterloo due to his waiting to finish a bowl of
strawberries before entering battle. Grouchy herself was educated privately at home
through her brothers’ tutors before being sent to a ‘finishing school’. There, she read
the latest in French philosophy and translated works from English and Italian into French. Upon finishing her education, she married Nicolas de Condorcet (a
mathematician and philosopher in his own right) and they began a life together as
intellectual equals. They opened a salon in Paris where they invited and entertained
esteemed guests and hosted intellectual conversations. Guests include royalty, British aristocrats, figures like Thomas Jefferson and Adam Smith, along with women’s
rights advocates like Olympe de Gouges.135 The salon also served as a meeting place
for political movements like the feminist Cercle Social and liberal anti-monarchist
Girondist movement. However, this life eventually came to an end when Condorcet’s name was added to a list of enemies of the state by the French
revolutionary government. He was forced into hiding and died while fleeing the city.
With her husband now dead, Grouchy had their wealth confiscated by the
government and she earned a living by painting portraits until the end of the revolution. Once Napoleon took control of the country, she reopened her salon and
began promoting the legacy of her husband by working to publish his works and also
endeavored to publish her own translations of major philosophical works written in
English.
 
Like many of the sentimentalists we have so far discussed, Grouchy is interested in the nature of morality and in moral psychology. Further, Grouchy was
heavily influenced by Smith, who she knew personally and whose work she was a
proficient and successful translator of. It is no surprise, then, that she follows him in
seeing sympathy as crucial to our moral development. Yet, even if we say that sympathy is the crux of morality, we might still want to know where our sympathy
 
135 Grouchy was heavily influenced by Smith’s work and produced an incredibly popular French translation of his The Theory of Moral Sentiments. 
 
418 comes from in the first place. Why do we have it rather than not? Here, Grouchy
turns to infants. In this case, she points out that nearly all humans up to and
including those in her own time, begin life in a period of nursing.136 This means that
the infant’s sole source of pleasure is in the cooperation of another human, and the biggest deprivation of pleasure is in their absence. By the time that they are able to
survive without their mother or wet-nurse, the association of pleasure and pain with
this other person has led to the development of sympathy. Once children sympathize
with their mothers, moral and political development is merely a matter of expanding
their sympathy to the entire family, the community, the country, and, eventually,
humanity in general.137 Thus, Grouchy is something of a synthetic philosopher.
Hume had told us that moral development was a matter of identifying our happiness
with others at a young age and expanding that goodwill outwards to more and more
people, and Smith had told us that it is sympathy rather than mere happiness that grounds moral behavior. With Grouchy, we can unify these two accounts; our own
happiness as dependent infants is the reason for our developing sympathy in the first
place (through the process of feeding), and it is empathy (not happiness directly)
which accounts for our moral judgements. She also pushes the political implications of this view further than those that came before her including, notably, Adam Smith.
Here, Grouchy points out that if moral behavior requires the ability to feel sympathy
towards others, we must be able to identify with them. Unfortunately, Grouchy
claims, the enormous gaps in wealth between the richest and poorest of society make it impossible for the two groups to identify with one another. For all intents and
purposes, the rich simply see the poor as a different species. Accordingly, in
Grouchy’s view, a truly moral society requires economic equality.138
 
136 While the diets of some infants were supplemented with the milk of nonhuman animals as far back as 2000 B.C.E., infant formula was invented in 1865 C.E., 67 years after the initial publication of Grouchy’s Letters on Sympathy (Stevens et. al 2009). 137 Another sentimentalist thinker from the period offering a developmental account of morality (and also writing extensively on issues in aesthetics) is the Scottish poet and philosopher Joanna Baillie. 
138 The feminist philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft makes a similar point on issues relating to gender (and also drawing on Adam Smith’s moral philosophy); gender segregated spaces (such as the all-male workplace at the time) hamper with our ability to properly sympathize 
419
Mary Shepherd 
 
Based on what has been said so far, it may seem like Scottish philosophy
during the early modern period forms a rather unified lineage; Shaftesbury (the
Englishman) influences Hutcheson, Hutcheson influences Hume, Hume influences
Smith, and Smith influences Grouchy (who is technically French, but working in the
Scottish intellectual tradition). In some ways, we can go further and say that this sentimentalist strain was just one part of the larger British empiricist tradition.
However, Margaret Cavendish and Anne Conway have already complicated this
account. Indeed, while they have not so far been the focus of our discussion, there
were a number of early modern rationalists in Britain as well. One famous school,
centered around Benjamin Whichcote, became known as Cambridge 
Platonism.139 As Platonists, they were adamant defenders of the power of reason to
give us knowledge, but they wed this to criticisms of scholasticism and a thorough
defense of Christian theology and moral philosophy. In turn, Scotland eventually saw its own critics of the empiricism of the sentimentalists and skepticism it
represents. Principally, these criticisms came from Thomas Reid and Mary
Shepherd. Reid, in many ways, follows in the footsteps of Berkeley, defending what
he views as the commonsense view from empiricist representationalists like Locke and Hume. Where Hume uses Locke’s’ representationalist model to argue that there
is no cause and effect (as evidenced by the fact that we never observe a causal power
directly), Reid argues that we observe our own causal powers every day when we
make decisions and act. We then form a sense impression based on our direct
 
with those of other genders and, as such, ought to be abolished. Because of this work, Wollstonecraft is often credited as being instrumental to feminism’s ‘first wave’, the fight for suffrage and on other political rights.  
139 Other Cambridge Platonists include Ralph Cudworth (father of Damaris Masham), who argued for atomism, Christianity, and the moral perfectibility of humans, and Henry More, who we first encountered as the tutor of Anne Conway. The Cambridge Platonists would have a profound impact on a number of later women philosophers, like Frances Power Cobbe, who argued that there are universal and objective moral laws, that our highest good is virtue, and that the fullest expression of our virtue requires that we care for animals. Meanwhile, Catharine Macaulay, another philosopher inspired by the Cambridge Platonists, argued against the political philosophy of Thomas Hobbes and in favor of a republican government.   
 
420 acquaintance with our own powers of causation and apply the corresponding idea in
describing the world. This position, a general orientation towards the way that
philosophy should be done, became known as common sense philosophy, and
Reid’s version will impact Shepherd’s own criticisms of sentimentalism.
 
Mary Shepherd was born into power and wealth in Edinburgh in Scotland, on the family estate at which she lived until she was thirty. While she was
privately educated in philosophy, Latin, mathematics, and history, it wasn’t until
Hume’s theories began to be accepted that she was moved to write (though these
works would not be published until years later). On her account, reading defenses of Hume’s philosophy demonstrated to her that there was widespread public
susceptibility to Hume’s dangerous views, and she saw her own mission in
countering his ideas. However, this period of writing eventually ended when she
married the English lawyer Henry John Shepherd and the two traveled to Cambridge so that he could complete a master’s degree. There, they befriended a number of
intellectuals, including the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, the scientist Mary
Somerville, the economists Tomas Malthus and David Ricardo, and the
mathematician Charles Babbage.140 These friendships followed the couple to London where, maintaining a number of intellectual correspondences, Shepherd
remained for the rest of her life. Shepherd would go on to have three children before
finally beginning to publish her work, and she would enjoy some minor success in
writing over the next twenty years until she passed away at the age of 69.
 
We can begin our discussion of Shepherd’s attack on Hume with her treatment of causation. Recall that Hume is skeptical that there is any substance to
our claims about causation. Of course, Hume will say, we clearly observe a regular
pattern of one thing followed by another (such as the regularity with which a fire
starting follows a match being struck); our mistake is in claiming that there is a ‘causal force’ at work, by which the first event brings about the second. This is to say
that there are just two events being seen (e.g., the striking of the match and the
emergence of a flame); we simply didn’t see anything more than that. Here,
 
140 th David Ricardo was a major influence on the thought of the 19 century German philosopher Karl Marx. More will be said about Marx and Ricardo’s influence on him in the “19th Century Continental Philosophy” chapter. 
 
421
Shepherd works backwards from Hume’s worldview. If there is no causation, then
things merely pop into existence. Nothing brought about the flame, it simply came
to be of its own accord, as it is wont to do, after the striking of the match. However,
Shepherd points out, coming to be is an action, and something must have performed that action. If we say that the flame just began, there must be a flame which is
capable of performing the action of ‘beginning’. However, since the flame does not
exist prior to the match being struck, there is no object which can perform the action
of beginning. How, after all, can a flame will itself into existence if it is not already
there to do things? Accordingly, something else must have acted so as to bring the flame into existence. This, in her view, proves that the match caused it to come into
being.
 
Importantly, this picture is very much in keeping with her larger
metaphysical view. To Shepherd, objects simply are bundles of capacities or powers. Whereas Locke has told us that objects (like hares, crabs, and old trucks) are
substances which we can learn about through their qualities, Shepherd argues that
objects just are their qualities. Accordingly, a match is a bundle of capabilities that a
match has (its length, its hardness, its ability to cause fire, etc.), and the process of causation is just the creation of new bundles of qualities. Where we might think that
causation involves two events (i.e., a cause and an effect) which are ordered in time
(with the cause prior to the effect), Shepherd thinks that we must abandon this view
in order to avoid Hume’s conclusion. Instead, causation involves two things being combined at a single time to produce a third thing. In the same way that blue and
yellow create green, the friction and the match are mixed together to create a flame.
This mixing happens in only one moment, as opposed to two. This allows Shepherd
to avoid Hume’s problems of causation; we don’t need to see a force at work
between two moments, we simply need to see the combined friction and match forming a flame in a single moment, and that creation is evident in the fact that the
flame has a number of capacities that friction and matches alone do not (namely, the
capacity to burn).
 
With this basic framework in hand, Shepherd is now in a position to argue (against Berkeley) for the reality of the external world. Remember that Berkeley had
argued against Locke’s representationalism with a burden-shifting argument; if
external objects exist independent of our perceiving them, prove it without
 
422 appealing to our sense perceptions. Indeed, Locke was forced into a position of
saying that we can’t directly know the fundamental nature of everyday objects
themselves, only their perceptible qualities. Notice, however, that there is no such
problem on Shepherd’s account; objects just are their perceptible qualities. Accordingly, (like Berkeley) she avoids positing any extra-perceptible substance
which we don’t have access to. However, unlike Berkeley, this does not mean that
objects are just ideas in our heads. Since reason has revealed the law of cause and
effect and shows it to be more than a psychological phenomenon (as Hume would
have it), then reason reveals that we are justified in believing in an external world of objects which act causally to create new objects.
 
Finally, having secured the safety of causal laws and the external world from
the empiricists, Shepherd concludes by attempting to prove the existence of an
enduring self. Again, she is able and ready to appeal to her account of causation in the service of this effort. Here, Shepherd returns to the basic representationalist
picture endorsed by most philosophers of the time; objects out in the world act on
our sensory organs, leaving sense impressions, which we then use to form ideas in the
mind. Notice that this story is a causal one; the object out in the world causes us to form an idea in the mind. However, Shepherd has already argued elsewhere that
causation is the combining of two or more bundles of qualities to produce a bundle
with new properties. If a sense perception comes into existence, it must be because
the object which we sense has been combined with something; this something is, for Shepherd, the self. Our forming an idea of the golden retriever we are currently
looking at requires the mixture of the dog out in the world with a mind capable of
thought. Thus, Shepherd concludes that the self has some continued existence as one
of the underlying causes of our perceptions. Incidentally, this is not entirely
dissimilar from the line taken by another of Hume’s critics: Immanuel Kant.

Immanuel Kant 
 
We have already said that David Hume had a profound impact on the
history of philosophy. While part of this impact comes directly from his
contributions and the influence he had on his followers, a great deal of his influence also comes from the reactions that he inspired against his views. None of these critics
has done more to change the trajectory of philosophy than Immanuel Kant. Kant
was born in the town of Kӧnigsberg in the now-Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.
While it is currently under the political control of the Russian Federation, at the time of Kant’s life, its position on the southeastern corner of the Baltic Sea meant that it
was inhabited by German speakers and fell within the German Kingdom of Prussia.
Accordingly, Kant was born into a devout German Lutheran family. Both, his father
and his maternal grandfather, worked as saddle makers. Despite his modest upbringing, Kant received an education at the local Pietist Lutheran school (a sect
that is known for being especially strict with regards to personal morality and pious
sentiment). After leaving at the age of sixteen, Kant began attending the University
of Kӧnigsberg, where he studied the works of the rationalist philosophers Christian Wolff and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (which was dominant in Germany at the
time). Upon completing this degree, he took up a job as a private tutor to children in
the rural areas outside of Kӧnigsberg, before returning to the city to take up a
teaching position at his alma mater (the University of Kӧnigsberg), where he would
remain for the rest of his life.  His early writings, undertaken shortly after securing this teaching position, focused on natural philosophy, covering topics ranging from
tidal locking to the formation of the solar system to the Coriolis effect. These works
were, in many ways, pioneering. For instance, he was among the first to articulate the
now widely supported ‘nebular theory’ of the origins of the solar system, and his work on earthquakes was among the first naturalistic (rather than supernatural)
explanations offered of them. These later writings, while false accounts of the causes
 
427 of earthquakes, were incredibly popular, with readers buying them by the page in
some cases. The success of these writings meant a strenuous teaching schedule for
Kant; he lectured twenty hours a week, and on topics as diverse as logic,
mathematics, ethics, physics, metaphysics, and natural geography. As Kant continued writing, his lecture topics also continued expanding; eventually covering
theology, anthropology, mineralogy, and military sciences. These studies pushed
Kant away from the rationalism of Leibniz and Wolff into a more Platonist
direction, but this movement did not last long.
 
Shortly after first publishing his Platonist views for the first time, Kant’s intellectual life was thrown into disarray. It was then that he first encountered the
work of Hume and, in Kant’s terms, it awoke him from his ‘dogmatic slumber’.
Rather than publishing his now anticipated next work, Kant was so moved by
Hume’s ideas that he committed himself to a period of intense and critical thought in which the next decade would be dedicated entirely to addressing Hume’s
skepticism. During this time, Kant worked out a comprehensive and unified theory
which touched on issues in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics. The
fruits of this labor began paying off when he published landmark works year after year, pouring his mind out onto the page. This time during Kant’s life has come to
be known as the ‘critical period’, and it saw Kant write six books over seven years
(many of which were revolutionary in their respective fields).
 
It is difficult to overstate the profound impact that these works had on the
course of philosophy. For one thing, almost overnight, Germany disregarded the Leibniz-Wolff rationalist framework and Kant’s philosophy came to be the
dominant force in the country. By the time that Kant published the last of the
critical period works in 1790, his groundbreaking Critique of the Power of Judgement,
the University of Jena (the central hub of German intellectual activity) had already dedicated a chair in the philosophy department to the study of Kant’s philosophy.
Kant would continue to leverage his fame and influence in an attempt to manage his
legacy, before retiring once he began to notice his own mental decline. To us, in the
present day, that legacy has many parts. Philosophically, Kant is one of the most important thinkers of all time. Personally, he was known to those around him as a
kind and affable man, prone to dressing in a highly fashionable way, and with a quite
strict disposition towards his own private life. For instance, many in Kӧnigsberg
 
428 talked about his habit of morning walks and said that you could set your watch by
seeing him walk past outside your window. This walk was an essential part of his
morning routine, which always began in the early hours before dawn, when Kant
instructed his servant to wake him simply by announcing “it is time.” He also wrote extensively about the proper way to party: advocating for categorizing one’s friends
and inviting them in certain combinations and not others, for drinking different
kinds of alcohol at different times of the night, and for discussing topics only in a
certain order. He enjoyed making mustard for his friends and garnered a local
reputation as a pool shark. Despite these idiosyncrasies, Kant leaves a lasting legacy on the field. His intelligence was so highly regarded that, when his body was forced
to be moved from one burial spot to another, researchers took measurements of his
skull in hopes of understanding whether his large forehead could give them insights
into his massive intellect. Even today, inhabitants of Kӧnigsberg often visit his grave on the day of their wedding.
 
Metaphysics & Epistemology 
 
If Kant was motivated to revolutionize philosophy based on his reading of
Hume, we should understand why and in what way Hume was able to have this
profound impact. As we have already said, as a young scholar, Kant was steeped in the rationalist tradition. These thinkers (such as Descartes) had proven, or attempted
to prove, all manner of things, including the existence of God and the self, the
fundamental nature of reality, and the immortality of the soul. However, Hume had,
apparently successfully, divided all of knowledge into relations of ideas and matters of fact, and this had troubling implications for the rationalists. While science, which
was at this time emerging as a field distinct from natural philosophy, had its own
domain in the matters of fact, it would ultimately not be rationally justified; our
belief in the power of inductive reasoning and causal laws are ultimately just a habit we have. On the other hand, we can have certain knowledge of relations of ideas, but
they are exactly that: relations of ideas. While mathematical reasoning can tell us that
two plus two certainly and necessarily equals four, this means nothing about our
 
429 physical world; what we mean by the words ‘two’, ‘plus’, and ‘four’ are perfectly
defined, but whether they map onto our lived reality is a matter of fact that we can
never be certain of. This casts doubt on our ability to derive knowledge of the soul,
the self, causal laws, the nature of the world, and God’s existence. Without knowledge of these things, the entire philosophical project is rendered a matter of
speculation and mental games. Kant, having read Hume, wants to find a place for
philosophy in our lives.
 
Since Hume’s division of knowledge into the relations of ideas and matters
of fact lies at the root of Kant’s troubles, it is there that we can start. Here, Kant notices something that has seemingly escaped Hume; that we have so far assumed
that necessary truths are the kind you get from pure rationalization and that
contingent truths are the kind you get from experience. While this is often the case,
that what is necessarily true is identical to what we know from reason alone (and vice versa) is something that must be shown. If these are actually two ways, instead of
one, of carving up the body of all knowledge, then we could wonder whether it is
possible to have necessary truths from experience or contingent truths prior to it.
Kant then sets out to make this landscape clearer.
 
First, we can distinguish between the ‘a priori’ and the ‘a posteriori’. The a 
priori, for Kant, is what can be known from reason alone. Meanwhile, a posteriori knowledge is derived from experience. Notice that this distinction concerns from
where we derive knowledge. This division makes up one axis of knowledge for Kant,
but there is also another axis. Here, Kant distinguishes between the analytic and synthetic. In order to explain this difference, Kant uses a peculiar description; he tells
us that analytic truths are those in which the ‘predicate is contained in the concept’.
To illustrate, think of a statement like ‘all bodies are extended’. To know whether
this is true, we must first think about what we mean by ‘body’. Kant means us to think of bodies in the sense that physics describes, in which a body is a physical entity
with a continuous three-dimensional boundary. To be a body is to be the kind of
thing which is extended in space; to have a length, width, and depth. As you can see,
the predicate ‘extended’ is contained in the concept of body. To say that all bodies are extended is no different from saying all squares are rectangles; being a rectangle is
 
430
included in the definition of what a square is.141 Meanwhile, synthetic statements tell us something beyond what we already know and have contained in a concept.
For instance, that ‘all bodies are heavy’ is not obviously true; there is nothing in the
definition of ‘body’ (an object with a continuous three-dimensional border) that implies that bodies have weight. If it turns out that this statement is true, then we
have new information that wasn’t previously contained within our concept. By the
same token, if it turns out that ‘all squares are purple’ we seem to have learned
something new in a way that we haven’t when we are told that they are all rectangles.
Notice, here, that the distinction between the analytic and the synthetic concerns what makes our knowledge true (or justifies it).
 
With these distinctions in hand, we can wonder about each combination
across the two axes. First, there is the synthetic a posteriori statements. These are
those which we learn from experience, and which are not justified in terms of their meaning alone. All of the things that Hume called ‘matters of fact’ fall into this
category. Scientific truths, such as that the earth spins around the sun or that the
dodo is extinct, are synthetic a posteriori statements. We can’t know that dodos are
extinct without going out into the woods and checking (that is, it is an a posteriori truth), and dodos aren’t, by definition, extinct (that is, it is a synthetic truth).
Meanwhile, all of Hume’s relations of ideas are analytic a priori statements. That ‘all
squares are rectangles’ is true according to the definition of the concept ‘square’ (that
is, it is an analytic truth) and it is not the kind of thing we need to check by going outside and looking around (that is, it is an a priori truth). These two are intuitive
enough, especially as they map neatly onto Hume’s two categories of knowledge.
However, we might still wonder about the other two categories: analytic a posteriori
truths and synthetic a priori truths. The first, the analytic a posteriori, Kant rules out
as obviously contradictory.142 After all, if something is true in virtue of its meaning alone, then how could we have to double-check it with our own experience? The
 
141 Notice the similarities between what Kant says here and Leibniz’s idea of the predicate-in-notion principle. 
142 The idea that there are no analytic, and therefore no necessary, a posteriori truths will be called into question during the 20th century. Many philosophers today believe that the philosopher Saul Kripke has proven the existence of such statements. More can be read about Saul Kripke and his account of necessary a posteriori truths in the “Analytic Philosophy” chapter. 
 
431 other, the synthetic a priori, are more interesting to Kant. In fact, these are exactly
the kind of statements that would solve Kant’s initial problem. If there are
statements which aren’t obviously contained with the definition of the concepts they
refer to, and we can know them from reason alone, then we would have a role for philosophy (and therefore save some form of the rationalist project).
 
What would this synthetic a priori knowledge look like if we did have it?
Here, we can consider an example: our experience of seeing a puppy for the first
time. Presumably, we were very young when we first encountered a puppy and, since
it is our first time seeing one, we don’t have any experience to draw on. What would this encounter be like? Well, on the classic representationalist picture, we would see a
brown furry object and this impression would be left on our mind; as we move
through life, we form a more complex idea of what a puppy can be (for instance, the
impression of a dalmatian puppy revised our concept to allow for many different colored puppies, not just brown ones). However, Kant claims that we have already
missed a key piece of knowledge here. We don’t merely see brown and feel fur, we see
that brown blob of fur as being somewhere in relation to us, as being a certain size,
and as persisting in time. If we rewind the tape of our lives back to our very first experience of anything at all, we would still see the object as taking up space and
persisting continuously in time. If this is right, then our concepts of time and space
are known to us prior to experience (that is, a priori). On the other hand, we don’t
justify our concepts of ‘time’ and ‘space’ by appealing to their definitions (that is, that they exist is not analytically true). Thus, concepts like this are synthetic a priori.
 
Kant’s account of knowledge 
A priori  A posteriori 
( derived from  (derived from reason alone)  experience) 
 
( Analytic  E.g., ‘squares are  N/A contained within the concept ) rectangles’  
 
( Synthetic  E.g., ‘space’ and  E.g., ‘dodos are extinct’  go beyond the concept )  ‘time’ 
 
432
Notice that Kant has seemingly proved the existence of synthetic a priori
statements is a rather peculiar way.  Recall a standard syllogism from Aristotle’s logic:
 
1.   All ducks are birds.
2.   All birds are animals.
3.   Therefore, all ducks are animals.
 
This argument works precisely because we already know the nature of
animals, birds, and ducks, and we already know the definitions of ‘animals’, ‘birds’,
and ‘ducks’. In Kant’s terms, given that a duck is (by definition) a kind of bird, it is analytically true that all birds are ducks. Accordingly, the conclusion we have drawn
doesn’t go beyond what was already included in the concept; our premises concern
ducks and animals, and our conclusion concerns ducks and animals.
 
By contrast, let’s look at Descartes’ most famous argument:
 
1.   I think.
2.   Therefore, I am.
 
This argument has told us something new, that we didn’t already have in the
definition of thinking; we weren’t talking about the nature of the self or of existence
in general in our premise and yet, we were still able to conclude something we didn’t
already know. Arguments that do this are called transcendental arguments, because they are able to draw out conclusions which ‘transcend’ what was known
already; this is what makes it a transcendental argument. Here, Kant has given his own
transcendental argument for our synthetic a priori knowledge; we are able to infer
from our experience of the world that we know things (like space and time) prior to experience. Further, just as there are concepts which structure our experience prior to
that experience, there are innate synthetic a priori concepts which structure the way
we reason. Kant calls these concepts categories, and he ultimately concludes that we
have twelve, which can be divided up into four groups of three.143 They are as follows:
 
143 Later neo-Kantians, such as Johann Friedrich Herbart, will further develop this picture. For instance, we are also capable of having universal knowledge of representations. On Herbart’s view, phenomenal objects have a kind of inner ‘life force’, which explains their

7.  Inherence & Subsistence

Of course, our experience of the world may validate these categories, but only in the same way that our experience of bringing together pairs of physical things
validates our knowledge that ‘two plus two equals four’. Despite being validated a
posteriori, the statement itself is true a priori. These categories provide structure to
our experience of the world and allow us to reason about it. The mind is then (contra Locke), not a tabula rasa, but comes prepackaged with some knowledge that renders
the experiences of the senses possible. Notice that this flips the standard
representationalist picture. According to it, the objects act on our sensory organs,
leaving behind a sense impression, which then informs our idea of that object. In this
way, our thoughts about an object conform to it; they are shaped by the object through perception. However, in Kant's model, the way in which we perceive an
object is the result of our background synthetic a priori knowledge. We perceive the
puppy as persisting in time and space because we think in terms of time and space;
we don’t perceive time and space themselves as laws out in the world. As it turns out, for Kant, time and space are mental constructs, and the object as it appears to us is
 
persistence and unity. Since we do not perceive this force in experience, but through it, this also represents a transcendental argument.  
 
434 shaped by and conforms to our mental concepts. To aliens with very different kinds
of minds, and no or very different concepts of space and time, the objects would
appear very differently. Thus, what the sense impression is of is, in large part,
determined by us, rather than the world. To Kant, this represents a massive reorganization of how we view the world. Just as the astronomer Copernicus
changed the course of physics by arguing that the Earth revolves around the sun and
not the other way around, Kant claims that his argument that the world revolves
around and conforms to our minds and not the other way around represents a
cataclysmic shift in our understanding. Accordingly, he refers to this idea as his
Copernican Revolution, and he takes himself to have responded to Hume’s worries quite directly. While Hume is right that we can’t find things like cause and
effect out in the world, this does not mean that they aren’t real or that we can't have
universal knowledge of them. Rather, we should simply look inside of ourselves to find them and what is revealed by this ‘transcendental deduction’ is a universal
feature of how our minds work. It is this universality that grounds our claims to
knowledge about space, time, necessity, causation, and so much more. In this way,
Kant’s theory of the self is that it is whatever these mental categories attach to and, therefore, is whatever makes the world appear to us as it does.
 
Despite its apparent successes, we should be quick to point out an
important caveat to Kant’s Copernican Revolution. Our synthetic a priori categories
do not shape the objects themselves, only how they appear to us. While we and the aliens may have very different experiences of the same objects, there is some fact of
the matter about the way those objects actually are. Yet, how can we discover their
true nature if we are forever limited to our own experience, which is limited by and
shaped according to the categories of minds like ours? Recall that Locke had
different reasons for coming to a very similar conclusion; that we can never know the essence of substances, but only their qualities. For Kant too, this represents a
fundamental split in the nature of reality. On the one hand, there is the world of
things as they appear to us in experience. Kant calls this the phenomenal realm. On
the other side, there is the world of the objects in and of themselves, as they exist independent of our experience and independent of our categories. This world Kant
calls the noumenal realm. Experience and the synthetic a priori give us knowledge
of the phenomenal realm; we can know things about the perceptible qualities of
 
435 objects (their color, size, location, density, etc.) and we can know things about our
innate categories which carve up our experience and thinking. However, for Kant we
can’t actually know anything about the noumenal realm; we can’t know the nature
of objects outside of how they appear to us.
 
What are the implications of this view? First, it means that space and time are phenomenal properties. That is, they exist within our minds, and they are given
in experience (even if not by experience). Indeed, it may very well be that there is
nothing out there in the world actually resembling the way we think about space and
time; we necessarily think using these categories, but that doesn’t mean they exist in the noumenal world. It could be that there is nothing which our concepts of space
and time match or represent. Of course, it just as easily may be that our concepts of
time and space perfectly reflect laws about the noumenal world, and that space and
time exist out in the world in the same way that we think they do. The problem for Kant isn’t that objects don’t exist, but we can never know them in and of themselves.
In this way, while Kant may have transcended experience, our knowledge is still
limited to our ideas (experiential perceptions and pre-experiential categories).
Accordingly, philosophers refer to his metaphysical view as transcendental 
idealism.144
 
To better understand this, imagine somehow being born both needing and
wearing eyeglasses. However, these glasses are tinted blue. You don’t have a way of
seeing without them, and using them does allow you to see things a particular way,
but it also limits and shapes how things appear. For any given object, that thing may or may not be blue in reality, but it certainly appears blue to you. You have no access
to these objects as they really are, because the very thing that makes it possible for
you to see them in the first place also structures your experience of them. For Kant,
the categories do this for our experience of the world. The categories, alongside time and space, give shape to the world, allowing you to form an image of it and to
 
144 We can contrast this with the absolute idealism of Vasubandhu and George Berkeley, in which only appearances, and not mind-independent objects, exist. By contrast, Kant’s idealism concerns what we can have knowledge of, not what exists (as he doesn’t think we could know this either way). However, absolute idealism will become popular in Germany in the time after Kant, when later absolute idealists such as Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi will ask, like Berkeley, why we should posit the existence of noumenal objects altogether.  
 
436 interact with it. Yet, they also block you from real genuine knowledge of the things
in and of themselves. The categories of the mind are our tinted corrective lenses, for
which we should be grateful for making the world intelligible to us, but which also
condemn us to a particular and skewed view of it, albeit one that may or may not be true.
 
Given this rather large caveat to our understanding, Kant has not saved
much of philosophy from Hume’s skepticism. We still, for instance, can’t come to
genuine knowledge about traditional philosophical questions like God’s existence
and why there is something rather than nothing. These questions concern the noumenal realm. However, Kant has still found some secure role for philosophy and
for rationalism: philosophical reasoning can provide us with genuine knowledge
about the nature of our minds, experience, and selves. For Kant, the self, like all
things, can be divided into the thing in and of itself (in the noumenal realm) and the way in which it appears to us (in the phenomenal realm). While we may not have
access to our noumenal selves, our phenomenal selves are actually quite informative,
because the self as it appears in thought is rather robust. For instance, we know that
the phenomenal self has thoughts, desires, beliefs, impressions, makes judgements, and produces actions. This last point is especially important for Kant, as once we
know that our phenomenal selves reason and freely act on the basis of those reasons,
this can form the basis for a moral philosophy. Accordingly, the domain of ethics
turns out to be one in which philosophy can tell us a great deal, and Kant is happy to oblige.
 
437
Kant’s transcendental idealism

 
Ethical Philosophy 
 
When looking at Kant’s moral philosophy, just as when looking at his
metaphysics and epistemology, it is helpful to begin by starting from the context of
Hume. As we have already seen, Kant saw Hume’s skepticism about the power of philosophy as something to be overcome, and he has now secured the phenomenal
self (the self as it appears in thought) as a possible foundation for an ethical theory. If
this self is going to be our starting point, we should also be clear about where Kant is
hoping to end up. Recall that Hume argued that reason ‘is and ought only to be a slave to the passions’. While our thoughts and beliefs (the domain of reason) do
inform our actions (e.g., you need to believe that cookies are food before you can be
motivated to go look for cookies when you are hungry), they are not sufficient to get
us to act. That we ought to go look for cookies requires that we first have a desire (in Hume's terms, a passion) for cookies. Without already being hungry, and therefore
placing a value on cookies, we can’t conclude that we ought to value finding them.
This, for Hume, is the ‘is/ought problem’; reason cannot lead us to conclude that we
 
438 should do something if we aren’t already motivated in some way which reason can tie
to doing that thing.
 
Kant finds Hume’s conclusion about the is/ought problem deeply
troubling. What good is philosophy if it can’t tell us how we ought to act ‘all things
considered’? Kant thinks that any good theory of morality will reflect the fact that moral considerations are overriding. As an example, imagine finding a wallet on the
ground outside your house. On the one hand, you will be financially better off if you
just keep the wallet, and that certainly has its perks. On the other hand, you probably
think that the right thing to do would be to return it. Here, we have considerations on both sides: the monetary considerations weigh on the side of keeping it and the
moral concerns weigh on the side of returning it. Kant thinks, like many people, that
moral considerations should always win out over other considerations. While we
may want to keep it, in the end, it doesn’t matter what we want because we must do the morally right thing. Morality is special precisely because it has this kind of force.
Notice that Hume’s theory seems to lack the resources to capture this. If it is a fact
that returning the wallet is the morally good thing to do, we can’t then conclude that
we ought to return it. Instead, we would need to already want to do the morally good thing. For Hume, we need an argument like this:
 
1.   We ought to do the morally good thing.
2.   Returning the wallet is the morally good thing.
3.   Therefore, we ought to return the wallet.
 
Without premise 1, we have no reason to conclude that we should return
the wallet, and accepting the first premise is a matter of what we actually do value.
What could we say to someone who simply doesn’t want to do the morally good
thing? This is the challenge that Kant will take up.
 
Kant begins by returning to the characteristic nature of our self; that we are rational actors. This is what makes it possible for us to be moral agents. After all, we
don’t put alligators or tornadoes on trial for hurting people. While we do say that the
‘reason’ the tornado destroyed your house was that there was moist warm air near
the ground, cool dry air above, and a sudden shift in wind speed and direction, we don’t mean this in the same way that we do in describing our own actions. The
 
439 reasons why alligators and tornadoes hurt people is ultimately a matter of instinct
and meteorology respectively. The reasons we provide amount to explanations of
why the incident happened. By contrast, with humans, we want justifications for
why something happened. You are able to be put on trial because, when you hurt people, you do it for reasons in the rich sense of the word. In fact, when someone
pushes you, as soon as they show you that they didn’t have a justification for doing it
and only an explanation (e.g., “I tripped and fell”), you will likely not want to hold
them responsible at all. By the same token, we take a person with a good reason for
pushing you (e.g., “I was trying to get you out of the way of that moving car!”) to offer an excuse, rather than a mere explanation. With this simple example, Kant
thinks we have already learned a great deal about morality.
 
First, if the difference between being blamed or not is a matter of having a
good reason for acting the way that we do, we might naturally want to know what makes for a good reason. Here, Kant thinks that a good motive would be good all of
the time and in every case; this would capture the universal force of moral laws.
What is a good reason for you, in your circumstances, must also be a good reason for
me, in my circumstance, and what is morally true for you is morally true for your neighbor, the person on the other side of the world, and people a thousand years on
either side of us. This rules out at least a few motives for acting right away. For
instance, if our reason for acting was, for example, so that we could get rich, being
rich (itself) isn’t always good. Sure, one rich person could do good by donating their money to charity, but another might just as easily use the money to hurt people.
Money, and the pursuit of it, is only instrumentally valuable; it is good for getting us
what we want. Yet, we have already seen that morality applies regardless of what we
want. What, then, is good all of the time and without any qualification? Kant’s
answer is that the only motive which is always good is good will.145 While serial killers can do great evils with more money, intelligence, strength, fame, and adoration, what all of their crimes have in common is that they don’t act from a
 
145 Kant’s answer is not the only one on offer. For instance, Salomon Maimon (a contemporary critic of Kant) argued that the examined life (or what he calls ‘striving after cognition) is the only thing that is unequivocally good in all circumstances. 
 
440 place of goodwill towards their victims. The same is true of all of those who victimize
others. Good actions, then, are the result of good intentions.146 
 
Consider a few examples. Imagine someone who donates enormous sums of
money to charity, but only does this as a tax write-off. Does this person deserve
praise? Are they a good person doing a good thing? Now imagine someone trying, at great personal risk to themselves, to save someone from drowning, but ultimately
failing to do so. For Kant, the philanthropist motivated by greed deserves no praise
and the attempted hero does, even though they didn’t actually accomplish their goal.
The difference between them is that one (the hero) acted out of goodwill and the other didn’t; what matters is their intentions. However, we can say more still.
Consider a case in which someone saves a drowning person but only because the
person drowning is their own mother. Does this person deserve praise? Kant’s
answer is, perhaps surprisingly, no. While their mom being saved may be a good thing in the end, their reason for acting isn’t always a good motive. After all, if a
judge interferes in a court case they are presiding over in order to save their mom
from facing punishment, justice has not been served. This means that acting with the
motive of goodwill requires acting in a particular way because it is your moral duty, not out of self-interest, emotion, or family ties. Accordingly, Kant then sets about to
determine what our moral duty is.
 
Recall that Kant’s problem with Hume is that the is/ought problem renders
all duties merely hypothetical. Sure, we have a duty to return the wallet we found on
the street, but only if we ought to be moral. Kant wants to find a way to tell everyone, including a person who doesn’t want to be moral, that they ought to be.
For him, this involves distinguishing between two different kinds of duties. First,
there are those like Hume discusses, which Kant calls hypothetical imperatives. Here,
an imperative is just a command which gives us a reason to act, and a hypothetical 
imperative is a command which only gives us a reason to act given a hypothetical goal we could have. While it may be true that you must practice basketball to get to
the NBA, this command only actually gives us a reason to practice if we happen to
 
146 We have already encountered a theory of morality which emphasizes our intentions for acting rather than the consequences of our action in the thought of Héloïse d’Argenteuil and Peter Abelard. 
 
441 want to be in the NBA. By contrast, that we must do our moral duty is, for Kant, a
categorical imperative, or a command which gives us reason to act in a particular way regardless of what we happen to want. In his Groundwork of the Metaphysics of 
Morals, Kant provides four different statements (often called ‘formulations’) about what this entails exactly; the first two are especially influential within philosophy and
will be important for us to discuss.
 
Kant’s first formulation of the categorical imperative tells us that we must
‘act only according to that maxim whereby we can at the same time will that it
should become a universal law.’ This statement, like much of Kant’s work, requires
some unpacking in order to understand. A maxim, for Kant, is a statement consisting of an action and a reason for action. To illustrate, we can return to the
example we discussed above: practicing basketball in order to get to the NBA. Here,
the action that we plan to do is ‘practicing basketball’ and our reason for acting in this way is ‘in order to get to the NBA.’ Since Kant thinks the distinct thing that we
can know about our phenomenal selves is that we are free and autonomous and that
we rationally choose our actions, we should be able to clearly state our maxim in any
case. Further, because moral responsibility seems to be deeply connected to our intentions, by stating our maxim clearly, we can then assess the morality of our
intentions. The first formulation then tells us that the good intentions we can act
from are those that we could, at the same time, will to be a universal law. This just
means that, in evaluating the morality of our actions, we should ask ourselves whether the goal of our acting (the reason part of the maxim) could be accomplished
in a world in which everyone behaved according to it. The first formulation, and the
moral test it provides, has come to be known as the principle of 
universalizability.
 
To illustrate how the principle of universalizability works, let’s consider two examples. First, imagine someone whose maxim is that they plan to cut in line in
order to get to the restaurant counter quicker. Here, their action is ‘cut in line’, and
their reason for acting is ‘get to the restaurant counter quicker’. Kant’s principle of
universalizability asks us to imagine a world in which everyone cut in line in order to get to the restaurant counter quicker. Now, we should ask ourselves whether we
would get to the counter quicker from cutting in line in this world. The answer, in
this case, is probably not. In fact, we would probably never actually make it to the
 
442 counter because everyone in line would just spend their time shuffling around in
order. Cutting in line is only a shortcut because other people don’t do it; they just
provide the bodies to be cut in front of. In a world in which everyone is cutting in
line, none of us would benefit. Since we can’t actually accomplish the goal of our maxim in a world in which everyone follows it, Kant argues that it fails the principle
of universalizability and is immoral for this reason.
 
Now let's look at another case; one in which our maxim is that we plan to
donate money to a charity in order to reduce world hunger. Here, our action is
‘donating money to charity’, and our reason for acting is ‘in order to reduce world hunger’. Does this maxim pass the test of universalizability? Well, would world
hunger be reduced in a world in which everyone donated money to charity? The
answer to this question is almost certainly yes! If everyone chipped in, it would go a
long way to reducing world hunger, so our maxim is universalizable. We can see, in both cases, the principle of universalizability working; what we thought was wrong
to do has failed the test and what we thought was good to do has passed. Yet, before
we move on, we should point out something about what makes a maxim fail for
Kant. While the world in which everyone is constantly cutting in line does sound like a worse place than our own (at least, for those who are ready eat), the maxim doesn’t
fail because this world is a less enjoyable place than the real world. By the same token,
while the world in which everyone is donating money to reduce world hunger
sounds so much better than our own in terms of the consequences it would have for those currently suffering from hunger around the globe, the maxim doesn’t pass the
test because this would be an improvement. Remember that Kant is interested in our
intentions for acting and not their consequences. These two maxims fail and pass the
principle of universalizability because we, ourselves, would and would not
(respectively) get what we want in the worlds they endorse. This difference is crucial for Kant, and this formulation is as it is for a specific reason.
 
We started out, in Kant’s moral theory, hoping to provide people with a
reason for behaving morally regardless of what they want, and with the principle of
universalizability, Kant thinks he now has one. To illustrate this, Kant asks us to imagine a person who is totally rational, and who knows right from wrong, but
simply doesn’t want to be moral. Because they are rational, they act for reasons
describable by maxims like those we discussed above (and for this reason, they are
 
443 capable of moral responsibility). Because they know right from wrong, we know that
they aren’t simply misinformed or ignorant about the concept of morality or the
morality of any particular action. Instead, the only thing stopping this person from
being a fully moral agent is that they don’t want to be one; on Hume’s account, they have no pre-established ‘ought’ which makes the duties of morality salient and
pressing for them. We can call the problem of providing this person with a reason to
be moral the amoralist’s dilemma. Kant thinks that the specifics of the principle
of universalizability address this problem. Since the amoralist is rational, they are
consistent in their reasoning. If, for instance, there was an inconsistency in their position, then they would be compelled by their rationality to change their mind to
the more consistent position; we have seen this as far back as Socrates’ interrogation
of Euthyphro. With the principle of universalizability in hand, we can now point to
any given immoral behavior that the amoralist engages in and point out that they are being inconsistent. To the line cutting immoralist, we can say that they assert a rule
for themselves (‘cutting in line is a good way to get to the restaurant counter
quicker’), but that they don’t actually believe that it’s a good rule; they know that if
people took their advice, it wouldn’t actually work. In just the same way that morality has a universal scope, rationality does as well. What is rational for one
person is rational for another, and throughout time and space. The amoralist holds
two opposing rules for how to get rich in their head, and therefore must adopt the
consistent position of only acting according to universalizable maxims. Thus, Kant thinks that we now have an answer to Hume: you must conclude that you ought to
behave morally regardless of what you want because to do otherwise would lead to a
contradiction.147 Further, the principle also captures what makes the action bad to
do in the first place; you are making an exception of yourself. The amoralist wants to receive all of the benefits of others good behavior while not being burdened,
themselves, by the responsibilities that a good society entails. The person who cuts in
front of others in line doesn’t actually endorse cutting because, if they did, there
 
147 Some of those following after Kant, such as Johann Gottfried von Herder, defended Humean sentimentalism against Kant’s claims. Herder argued that because, descriptively, we are motivated by our passions and not reason, we should worry that building a moral system off of reason will lead us to deny or weaken our genuine moral sentiments. 
 
444 would be constant order shuffling, and no one would make it to the front. Rather,
they want to treat themselves as above the rules; ‘morality for thee and not for me’.
 
You can see that Kant thinks that rationality and morality are deeply tied
together; being moral is always the rational thing to do. The root cause of this
connection is the importance of consistency. For Kant’ moral rules, like rational rules, are universal and absolute. Kant famously illustrates this in a particular
thought experiment. Imagine that you are home, watching reruns of Buffy the 
Vampire Slayer on a Sunday afternoon. Then, right before a great fight scene
between Buffy and The Judge, you hear a knock on the door. When you answer it, you find a panicked small child who quickly tells you that there is a murderer chasing
them and that they need a place to hide. Naturally, being a good and moral person,
you bring the child in, set them up somewhere safe, and call the police. However, as
you wait for the police, you hear another knock on the door. This time you open the door to find an ax-wielding man with a deranged look in his eye and whose shirt is
covered in blood. He tells you that he is (or rather, would like to be) a murderer, and
that he is currently looking for a victim that got away. He describes his potential
victim’s appearance to you, and it quickly becomes clear that he is the person trying to murder the child you are hiding. The murderer then asks you whether the victim
they are after happens to be in your house. You now seem to have two options: 1) tell
the murderer the truth that their target is hiding in the house, or 2) lie and say that
you haven’t seen them.
 
Many reading this will think that the safer, and thus all-around best, answer is option 2. However, lying (for Kant) does not pass the principle of
universalizability. A world in which everyone lies in order to improve their situation
and get what they want is a world in which no one improves their situation or gets
what they want. On Kant’s view, it can’t be good to lie sometimes, for some people, and in some contexts. If it is immoral to lie, then it is always immoral for everyone
and in every context. Thus, Kant thinks that we aren’t permitted to lie even in the
case of hiding a murder victim. While Kant doesn’t specifically ask us to imagine we
were watching Buffy reruns when this happens, he does bring up the scenario of hiding a murder victim himself in his discussion of why lying is always wrong. As
you can imagine, this thought experiment, of the murderer at the door, has
 
445 generated a lot of interest among philosophers, many of whom are skeptical that it is
wrong to lie to hide the victim.
 
The absolute consistency which Kant’s system advocates for has another
important consequence, this time with regards to justice. If the person who steals
asserts (by stealing) that stealing, as an action, is worth doing for them and for them alone, then nothing would point out the inconsistency of their position more that
having a taste of their own medicine. For this reason, Kant endorses what is known
as the law of retribution (also known by the Latin ‘lex talionis’). This tells us that
justice consists in giving the offender a punishment which is similar in degree and kind to their offense. First, we should notice that this is a form of retributivism, in
that justice means punishing offenders as their just deserts. However, it is more
specific in saying that there should be a strong resemblance between the crime and
the punishment. In its most literal form, we can think of the Babylonian Code of Hammurabi, and its declaration that punishment should be ‘an eye for an eye’. Yet,
Kant is not so literal as to endorse punishments needing to exactly mirror the
offense. More importantly, it is the relationship between the punisher and the
punished that takes on a strong Kantian flavor. In order to understand this, we must
turn to Kant’s second formulation of the categorical imperative, the principle of 
humanity.
 
Though Kant intends the different formulations of the categorical
imperative to describe one unified theory of morality, they do differ in how they
shape our moral reasoning. You can see this in the difference between the principle of universalizability and the principle of humanity. This tells us that we ought only
to treat humans (ourselves included) as ‘ends unto themselves, and never as a mere
means’.148 While this rule follows the principle of universalizability in its concern for
our treating ourselves and others in a fair and consistent manner, it also shares in its focus on goal-directed action. Here, we should think about the way that we treat
objects as opposed to persons. When we interact with our house keys, in Kant’s
 
148 The principle of humanity was preferred over the principle of universalizability by some later Kantians, like Fredrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher, who argued this from a cosmopolitanism position, saying that the principle of humanity allows for more individuality between persons and more room for cultural differences between peoples.   
 
446 terms, we treat them as a means to an end. A key is only valuable insofar as it helps us
open a lock; once it stops being able to fulfill that function, we simply disregard it.
This is because the key is ‘instrumentalized’ in our thinking, to be thought of as an
object to be used to accomplish a particular end, or goal, of opening the lock. Kant’s principle of humanity tells us that it is fine to treat objects in this way (that is, as
objects), but that we should never objectify humans. However, like the principle of
universalizability, the specific way in which Kant words the principle of humanity
can tell us a great deal more if we are willing to unpack it.
 
First, we should wonder what Kant means by humanity. While you may think of ‘human’ as a biological category (perhaps referring to the genus Homo or
specifically to the species Homo sapiens), Kant’s account of humanity draws on the
distinctive and universal features of the mind which are given to us by our experience
of thought. Yet, if the principle of humanity is right, and morality is ultimately a rule system for how we ought to treat humans, then our only moral obligations are to
humans. For this reason, defining our terms becomes crucial, as we are allowed to
treat anything that falls outside of this category as an object. Kant’s definition of
humanity has two parts which form a set of criteria for inclusion in the moral community: rationality and autonomy. If something is a rational and autonomous
being, then it is a human and, if something is a human, then it is also a rational and
autonomous being. With regards to rationality, Kant sets the bar fairly high. In his
own time, Kant did not think that any nonhuman animals reached the level of rationality required for their being counted as members of the moral community.
Accordingly, we have no moral obligations to them.149 By contrast, we can certainly
imagine a highly advanced robot, capable of language, reasoning, and autonomous
decision-making (e.g., Star Wars’ C-3P0, Star Trek’s Data, the robots of Westworld,
or 2001: A Space Odyssey’s HAL 9000). Even if these robots are incapable of feeling pain, suffering, pleasure, joy, happiness, or sorrow, Kant would think that we do
have moral obligations to them as rational autonomous beings. That is, for Kant,
they would be humans.
 
149 Some modern Kantians, such as the philosopher Christine Korsgaard, have argued that this declaration was a mistake on Kant’s part, and that his system can and should be applied to nonhuman animals. 
 
447
Now that we know who counts as a member of the moral community, what
does treating a person as a mere means to an end consist in? Imagine that you want
to become wildly rich and successful by starting your own business selling
charcuterie boards for kids (a product you call charcutiesTM). As part of this effort, you begin to hire employees. Notice that your maxim for hiring an employee sounds
a lot like the way you think about your house keys; you are using the employee as a
means to get rich. Meanwhile, they are only working for you and selling charcuterie
boards to children in order to pay their own bills, so we can say that they are using
the customer and their employer as a means to an end. Finally, the customer is using this employee and yourself as a means to get child-sized portions of soppressata for
their toddlers. Everyone involved in this, or any commercial enterprise, seems to be
treating one another as means to an end! However, in this example, no one is using
anyone as a mere means to an end. The difference, for Kant, is that everyone is respecting the autonomy of the other autonomous beings involved. If you were to
lock the employee in the cheese factory and force them to work for you, or to force
the customer to buy your goods, then you would be using them as a mere means.
Instead, we need only to see that these other humans are rational and autonomous agents just like us and are deserving of equal recognition. This makes consent,
consistency, and autonomous agency central to morality.
 
The principle of humanity has a great deal going for it. First, it provides us
with a system for human rights, which can then be taken up by governments, research laboratories, and the international community. Beyond this, though, it also
explains why people hate being condescended to. For instance, if someone were to
stop you from ordering what you wanted at a restaurant and force you to buy
something healthier, they can say that they are just promoting the goal of public
health, and that their actions will make the world a better, happier, and healthier place. Yet, Kant’s system is not concerned with outcomes or consequences. Instead,
this person has not recognized you as an autonomous and rational being capable of
making your own decisions about what to eat; they have used you as a mere means to
achieve their goals for society. We can give a similar analysis for Kant’s persistent bugbear: lying. You may think you are sparing your friend when they ask whether
their sweater looks bad on them, and you lie and say it looks great. However, this is
paternalism in Kant’s view; you are treating them as if you are their parent and that
 
448 you know better than them what information they actually need to hear. However
good the goal of making them feel happy and confident is, it does not justify (on
Kant’s view) your using them as a means to achieve it. Instead, we are required to
recognize that they are rational, that they know the potential consequences of their question, and that they are prepared for an answer either way.
 
This anti-paternalistic attitude is also present in Kant’s defense of
retributivism. While many argue against punishment on the basis that studies have
shown that society has lower crime rates when we model our justice system around
rehabilitationism (or the view that criminal justice consists in bringing offenders back into society as productive contributors to it) instead. Notice, however, that this
means treating someone who commits a crime in a particular way so as to bring
about a particular consequence. Accordingly, we are certainly using them as a means
to an end, but are we using them as a mere means? Kant would answer that we are. They rationally and autonomously chose the course of their action in full knowledge
of what could happen if they were caught. Indeed, by not punishing them, we
dehumanize them. After all, we have already said that we don’t punish tornadoes and
alligators on the basis that they don’t act for reasons. To fail to punish an offender, for Kant, is to deny the very thing that makes them a person rather than an animal.
Perhaps counterintuitively, this means that we all have a right to be punished, that it
would be dehumanizing not to punish them. With that, Kant was able to get all the
way from our experience of the world to genuine, certain, and universal knowledge. Here, he has seemingly preserved the existence of space, time, causation, and the self,
along a system of morality and justice. This response to Hume will leave a massive
mark on philosophy in its wake, but so too does Kant’s aesthetics.
 
Aesthetics 
 
As we have seen, Kant can often be described as having synthesized the
rationalism of Leibniz and Wolff, which he was accustomed to in Germany, with Hume’s sentimentalist empiricism. For instance, he agrees with Hume that our
claims about causation don’t describe anything out in the world, but he finds a way
 
449 to say that we can still have universal and necessary knowledge about causation,
space, time, and a whole slew of other mental categories. Meanwhile, in ethics, he
sees and takes seriously Hume’s is/ought problem but attempts to answer it rather
than deny it; our rational and autonomous nature as humans compels us to accept the categorical imperative universally, even if it is not in our interest to do so. In the
realm of aesthetics, Kant’s view drifts closer to Hume’s and further away from his
fellow rationalists in Germany. However, we will see that his account still differs
considerably from Hume’s, and that he is able to push out in ever newer directions as
a result.
 
Recall the two sides to the current debate. In Kant’s native Germany,
Baumgarten has established aesthetic rationalism as the dominant view. Here,
aesthetic judgments are cognitive, universal, and rational.150 Meanwhile, the
sentimentalism that is popular in Britain, while divided on some of the details, sees judgements of beauty as an exercise of taste. Rather than reason, sentiment is central
to aesthetic life, allowing beauty to be a mental phenomenon (a secondary quality)
rather than out in the world. There are then two debates which are primary in
aesthetics during this time; one over whether beauty is in the world or in our minds, and one over whether our judgements of beauty are purely rational or not. Kant will
 
150 Two important aesthetic rationalists of the period, both influenced by Baumgarten, are Moses Mendelssohn (grandfather of the German Romantic composer Felix Mendelssohn) and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Moses Mendelssohn argued that the experience of beauty is the result of a ‘sensuously perfect representation’, or it is the representation of something perfect. According to this view, we judge something to be beautiful because, it presents all of the features of an object as a unified whole rather than as a collection of properties (only some of which are apparent to us) or, even if it falls short of this benchmark, the actual thing it represents is perfect and, therefore, beautiful. Importantly, the criteria for perfection (either in the representation or in the thing being represented) is a matter of it conforming to certain rules, which are knowable by reason. Notice, however, that our judging the object being represented as perfect means that Mendelssohn’s account is not committed to disinterestedness, since we are not wrong to allow our judgements about the content affect our views about the work. Meanwhile, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing was a defender of aesthetic hedonism, or the view that art is valuable insofar as it achieves its proper goal of giving its audience pleasure. While there are general rules, in Lessing’s view, for how to do this, an artistic genius may discover new rules or exceptions to them. This reflects the fact that we often admire the work of artists who break the established mold. More can be read about German Romanticism in the “The Idealists” chapter. 
 
450 follow Hume on both questions; asserting that beauty is not objective and in the
world, and that judging something to be beautiful is not, like judging something to
be a square, an exercise of pure rationality.
 
Kant sets out his aesthetic theory by first discussing beauty. However, rather
than directly analyzing beauty itself, Kant follows a strategy like the one he has used in epistemology and metaphysics; he starts by examining the way that we think and
reason about the topic. When we judge something to be beautiful, Kant claims that
this judgment has four distinctive features. First, like Hume, Kant thinks that claims
about beauty are disinterested. While Hume adopted an early version of this view, the term itself and its contemporary understanding actually originate with Kant. To
get at what Kant has in mind, it will be helpful to ask a question about the
relationship between beauty and pleasure; do we find great works of art beautiful
because we enjoy looking at them, or do we enjoy looking at great works of art because they are beautiful. Kant thinks that disinterested judgements begin with
beauty, which provides us with subsequent pleasure. This relates to our previous
discussion of disinterestedness in that judgements of beauty are made in and of
themselves; a work of art may make us happy the way that eating a slice of cheesecake makes us happy, or it may make us happy because of the impact we expect it to have
on society, but is pleasure is not the basis of an aesthetic judgment of beauty. Since
Kant doesn’t think that judgements of sensory pleasure are claims about beauty, he
instead refers to them as statements about what we find ‘agreeable’.
 
Next, Kant tells us that judgements of beauty are universal and necessary. These features represent the second and third distinctive attribute of aesthetic
judgements for Kant. When we think something is beautiful and tell our friends as
much, we fully expect them to find the same thing beautiful. Notice, after all, that as
often as we say “I loved it” about a movie we just saw, we also say “it’s so good!”. This second version seems to be describing something independent of our opinion
and claims to say something about the work of art itself, which anyone within
earshot should be able to agree to if they just go see the film. However, this doesn’t
mean that they are describing something in the world. In the same way that Kant thought we could all, in virtue of being humans, share in a universal (that is,
ubiquitous) subjective experience of space and time, Kant thinks the same is true for
 
451
beauty.151 Thus, he follows the sentimentalists in claiming that beauty is a mental
phenomenon.
 
Finally, judgements about beauty are ‘purposive’. This is to say that when
we call something beautiful, that thing seems to bear all of the hallmarks of having
been designed to fulfill a particular function. This, for Kant, is a characteristic feature of what it feels like to judge something beautiful. However, this apparent
purposiveness is actually illusory when it comes to beautiful objects. While the
purposiveness we recognize in a household gadget is genuine (that is, it was designed
to fulfill a particular function), the purposiveness we read into beautiful objects does not actually track a real purpose. Kant sees the difference between aesthetic
judgements and judgements about actual purposiveness as being related to the
disinterestedness of aesthetic claims. When we evaluate a kitchen gadget, we use the
criteria of utility: does it do its job and do it well? Does it benefit us? Meanwhile, since aesthetic claims are disinterested, we don’t evaluate artworks (for instance)
according to their utility. This isn’t to say that we can’t talk about whether it is good
for society to hear the message that a work puts out, but that this question is one
independent of its beauty. The difference is that we don’t judge things to be beautiful because they benefit us, despite their apparent purposiveness. This is made
most clear by the fact that no amount of good social utility (no matter how good the
moral message a work of art might have), that alone isn’t sufficient to make it
beautiful. We all know plenty of works of art which we agree with the political messages of, but which we nevertheless don’t actually think are good. Kant thinks
that if we were right to evaluate aesthetic objects according to their utility, then we
should expect there to be some works of art which are good films, books, or
 
151 Kant’s claim is that aesthetic judgements have ‘intersubjective validity’, or that when we tell someone that, for instance, the Grand Canyon is beautiful, we are predicting that our subjective experience is universally representative, and that they will have a similar experience if they see it. This could turn out to be true or false in the end. What determines the truth of this statement is ultimately a subjective matter of what it was like for them to see it, but our claims to beauty assume the universal validity of our own experience. 
 
452 paintings, solely because they are morally agreeable. Without these, it is clear that
utility does not and should not matter in judging beauty.152 
 
Now that we know which kinds of claims Kant is talking about when he
discusses aesthetic judgements (universal, necessary, disinterested, and purposive
judgements), we can now turn to the question of whether these kinds of judgements are rational or based in sentiment. As mentioned above, Kant follows his usual
trajectory of synthesizing what he finds to be best about the rationalists and the
sentimentalists (perhaps more so in aesthetics than in other domains). Rather than
coming down on one side or the other, Kant tells us that aesthetic judgements involve the ‘free play’ of the sensory faculty (which he calls ‘intuition’) and the
cognitive faculty. Thus, aesthetic claims aren’t exactly like other kinds of objective
claims (as the rationalists would have), but they do involve cognition. Yet, if our
engagement with beautiful things is a matter of mental free play between our various abilities, we might want to know the rules of play (especially if we are rule-loving
Kant).
 
Here, Kant tells us that proper disinterestedness involves cutting yourself
off from everything you find agreeable. Liking an object because it adheres to our political or moral sensibilities is only the most obvious way of being interested in our
aesthetic judgements for Kant.153 While he does think that we should cut ourselves
off from these kinds of interests and considerations in evaluating art, he also thinks
 
152 Notice the difference between Kant’s account of disinterestedness and Xunzi’s aesthetic instrumentalism, according to which we can find the value of art in its consequences. 153 While Kant has been attacked by a number of political thinkers throughout history for claiming that art is not properly evaluated based on its social utility, the relationship between Kant’s aesthetics and political progress is actually somewhat complicated. For instance, the French philosopher Germaine de Staël (who wrote extensively on German philosophy) argued that the instrumental and political way that art was thought of in the French Revolution enabled (in some ways) the atrocities which happened during that time. By contrast, she argues that Kant’s philosophy (including his aesthetic theory) ensures that the inner transcendence of the human spirit art is recognized and respected instead of being rendered merely instrumental within a political calculation. Aesthetic life’s role in this is, in her view, because it cultivates virtuous character. Thus, our political goals are best achieved, ironically, when we preserve spaces in which human life is not instrumentalized by political positioning. 
 
453 we shouldn’t even consider things like color or tone. Since these give us sensory
pleasure, focusing on them also amounts to making an interested judgment. Instead,
Kant argues that a proper aesthetic judgment will focus only on formal features of a
work (such as shape and arrangement). This position, known as ‘formalism’, will remain quite popular throughout the history of aesthetics up to the twentieth
century, and harmony, more than any of the other formal features we tune in to, is
central for Kant. This is because of its connection to purposiveness. Seeing
something as fulfilling a particular purpose often involves rationally reflecting on its
designed components and how they work together. This is a fundamentally rational process. However, in the case of aesthetic judgements, this purposiveness is
imagined. Thus, in our judgments about harmony, we can see the full extent of the
free play between intuition and cognition.
 
While Kant has already said a great deal about beauty, it is not the only kind of aesthetic judgment that he takes on. In addition to beauty, Kant also provides us
with an account of what he calls the sublime. In seeing something as beautiful, we
are able to imagine purposiveness that is not actually present. However, it is possible
(in Kant’s view) for us to have experiences involving the free play of cognition and imagination, but which actually exhaust our ability to imagine. These things, the
sublime, seem to confront and almost harass our capacity for discerning
purposiveness. For instance, imagine the experience of traveling through some
remote part of the world and coming upon a massive and ancient temple. The sheer size and complexity of the structure, especially given how old it is, gives us a sense of
awe. What do we say in such cases? We tell our traveling companions that we “can’t
even imagine how they could have built it.” We can see here that the awe we feel is an
aesthetic judgment, involving both intuition and cognition, but it is one in which
our intuition is quite simply overwhelmed. However, the sublime need not be physically massive or man-made. Kant also identifies natural phenomena (such as
landscapes, the open and starry sky, and intense storms) as potentially having this
effect on us. Likewise, some sublime things are ‘transcendent’. This, for Kant, means
they have to do with our inability to imagine the grandeur of God. In this way, what we perceive as sublime is very much like the noumenal realm. Recall that the objects
of the world in and of themselves exhaust our ability to have knowledge of them for
Kant. While Kant’s entire system will be taken up and defended by generations of
 
454
Kantians and Neo-Kantians, many others will follow in his footsteps while also
wondering why we should posit the existence of the noumenal realm at all. In this
way, Kant’s transcendental idealism sets up the rise of a movement of absolute
idealism in Germany. Accordingly, we turn to the topic of German idealism now.

The Idealists 
 
As we have already said, the agenda of philosophy at the end of the 18th
century was, in many ways, set by Hume. His skeptical challenges to notions of the
self, causation, and moral reasoning had awoken Kant from his ‘dogmatic slumber’, and the results of that were monumental. Kant’s sprawling and systematic
philosophy left no stone unturned, touching on morality, metaphysics,
epistemology, and aesthetics. The resulting picture carved out a space for philosophy
and a space for reason when thinking about the phenomenal world. We can, in Kant’s view, have synthetic a priori knowledge which goes beyond what our words
mean and beyond what we see in experience. This knowledge, given by experience
but not from it, refers to the ‘categories’. This is the term that Kant uses to describe
the universally valid concepts which structure our experience of the world and our thoughts without being grounded in it. For instance, Hume is right to think that we
can’t actually observe laws of causation out in the world, but this need not reduce us
to skepticism about their existence. Instead, Kant’s claim is that the law of causation
is a law of the mind which we cannot escape in virtue of the kind of creatures that we are. Causation, like all of the categories, is not something that we conclude on the
basis of rational thought. Rather, it is the precondition for the possibility of rational
thought in the first place. This tendency, to look to shared universal experiences as a
foundation for philosophical theorizing, also informs Kant’s moral philosophy and
aesthetics as well.
 
Yet, while Kant had saved a role for philosophy, this maneuver did come at
some cost. Most importantly, this life-saving procedure involved amputating the
world of appearances from the world of objects. Philosophy has a role in coming to a
priori synthetic knowledge of the categories, but it can’t tell us about the objects of the world in and of themselves. The noumenal realm, of objects as they exist
 
457 independently of the way in which we perceive them, stands forever out of reach. If
ants and tree frogs have different categories which shape their own experience and set
the limits of their own phenomenal realm, we can never settle our disputes between
us and them. Each kind of creature is siloed away in our own world of understanding, separated by the impassible gulf of the real. Here, just like we saw
with the ‘British empiricists’, it did not take long for other thinkers to begin to
wonder whether we should posit this noumenal realm at all. There is a certain
misfortune in consigning ourselves to one half of reality and saying that our minds
can never reach across that divide. However, why should we think these unknowable noumenal things exist at all? If there is only a phenomenal realm, then we lose much
of the sting of Kant’s concession. After all, what work are the objects in and of
themselves doing in a theory in which they can’t, by definition, reach out and touch
our understanding. With this, Kant’s transcendental idealism gave way to a flurry of absolute idealism in Germany. These absolute idealists (who together form the
school of German idealism), like Berkeley before them, say the noumenal realm as
superfluous. Instead, perhaps there is only the phenomenal realm, the world of ideas
and sense perceptions. Yet, perhaps paradoxically, while we might expect this to represent a turn inward insofar as it claims that the only reality is the reality of our
own mental experience, it also represents a striving back to the world. Reconciling
idealism with this external turn thus becomes the project of German philosophy in
this era. In this way, while the German idealists are bound together in denying Kant’s account of the noumenal world, they are also highly indebted to him, and his
transcendental methodology will shape the character of their own views. Kant’s
shadow looms large in 18th century Germany, and we can see what happens after his
critical period as a grappling with Kant’s influence.
 
Johann Gottlieb Fichte 
 
Johann Gottlieb Fichte was born into poverty in Saxony in eastern Germany. His parents were ribbon makers and, as such, could not afford for him to
be properly educated (despite his apparent intellect). This problem was briefly
 
458 remedied when the young Fichte attracted the attention of a local wealthy baron
who sponsored his private tutoring. However, this quickly came to an end after the
baron’s death, and Fichte was forced to take up employment as a private tutor. Just
as Hume had awoken Kant from his intellectual malaise, Kant paid that favor onto Fichte. While working as a tutor, Fichte encountered Kant’s philosophy, and he
described the results of this encounter as a revolution in his thinking. This
breakthrough was enough to motivate him to make his way to Konigsberg, where
Kant had scarcely left town in his life, to seek him out. Apparently, this meeting did
not go the way that Fichte had imagined, Kant left unimpressed with him. In turn, Fichte sought to demonstrate his mastery of the Kantian philosophical framework by
applying Kant’s theories to the relationship between philosophy and divine
revelation (a topic which Kant had left more or less untouched). By the time this
book, An Attempt at a Critique of all Revelation, had been published, Fichte had not only impressed Kant but had become an overnight sensation. It is likely that part of
the work’s success was the result of the fact that Fichte’s name was omitted from the
original edition, leading some readers to think it was a new work by Kant. By the
time that the error was fixed, audiences respected the author enough to extend that praise to Fichte. It wasn’t long after this that Fichte was invited to accept the chair at
the University of Jena which had been set up for research and education in Kantian
philosophy.
 
In Jena, Fichte divided himself between two roles: that of the academic philosopher and that of a popular advocate for enlightenment values. In terms of his
advocacy, he spoke in packed lecture halls on the importance of rationalism in the
political and religious spheres in addition to the emerging scientific sphere. With
regards to his academic life at Jena, Fichte used his time there to develop his
philosophical system, Wissenschaftslehre. While this word is often translated as the ‘science of knowledge’ or the ‘theory of science’, most philosophers prefer to leave
the term untranslated so as not to bias the reader’s understanding.  Regardless of
whether his system can be reduced to a simple phrase, it certainly had an impact in
philosophy. However, Fichte was still in the process of working out the details of this view when he was summarily released from his position at Jena. A controversy had
emerged, as a result of other writings, which led the public to accuse Fichte of
 
459
atheism.154 While his claims actually concerned the limits of our theorizing about
God and not God’s existence, explaining this difference amounted to too little too
late. This problem was only made worse when Kant published a letter disavowing
Fichte’s system and Kant’s most prominent critic (Jacobi) released his own letter accusing Fichte of nihilism. All of this, taken together, was enough to drive Fichte to
Berlin, where he would attempt to work as a private tutor once again. This period
saw Fichte publishing very little academic work and focusing his efforts on his
popular political writings. Fichte was ultimately able to weather this unstable period
in his life long enough to see the opening of a university in Berlin, which quickly appointed him as head of the philosophy faculty. Finally, when war broke out
between Germany and Napoleon’s occupying French forces stationed there, Fichte’s
wife volunteered as a nurse, tending to soldiers who were injured in battle. In this
role, she contracted an illness that, while she recovered from it, she passed on to her husband. Fichte would die from this illness.
 
In order to understand the Wissenschaftslehre, we must first understand
Fichte’s goal in writing it. As we have already said, Fichte was employed in the chair
at the University of Jena set up to study Kant’s philosophy. Importantly, Fichte was
the second person to hold this position, Karl Leonhard Reinhold, very much established the task for such a chair; to set Kant’s philosophy on some first principle.
In turn, this agenda was set even further back with Descartes. Recall that Descartes
had sought a firm, certain, and universal foundation for all of knowledge in the cogito (‘I think, therefore I am). Reinhold, in his capacity as the chair at Jena, sees
Kant’s philosophy as the basic picture, but sees Kant’s transcendental deduction
(that is, his deriving synthetic a priori knowledge in the form of the categories from
our experience of objects as existing in time and space), as incomplete. While Kant’s
presentation is plausible, in Reinhold’s view, we need a strong, clear, and simple truth which can ground this as universally true knowledge. Once we have some first
principle that we know is absolutely true, the project of philosophy is merely a
 
154 Kant’s most prominent contemporary critic, Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, famously wrote an open letter accusing philosophy (and especially Fichte’s) as amounting to mere nihilism. This was instrumental in turning public opinion away from Fichte and branding him as an atheist. This accusation stems primarily from Fichte’s claim that we should identify God with the absolute moral order of the universe. 
 
460 matter of deriving Kant's philosophical system from that principle; showing that the
entire framework follows logically from it.
 
Reinhold’s answer to the first principle of philosophy, known as the
principle of consciousness, is that “in consciousness, the subject distinguishes the
representation from the subject and the object and relates the representation to
both.”155 According to this view, our being conscious always implies three
components: a subject, a representation, and an object. Following Kant (and Hume
before him), Reinhold believes that, when we are conscious, we are always conscious
of something. However, Reinhold goes further by claiming that by being conscious of something, we also distinguish ourselves and the object of thought. For instance,
when we see an apple, we are conscious of the representation of an apple happening
in the mind, but we also see that representation as inherently representational. That
is, we see the apple in our mind as necessarily representing some object out in the world (namely, the apple). At the same time, we also know ourselves as the subject of
that representation; the apple is represented to us. This is the basic framework of
conscious experience for Reinhold, and it is this single fact that Reinhold hopes will
be sufficient to prove Kant’s system. While few were convinced of Reinhold’s system for proving Kant’s theory as a perfect science of philosophy, a system which came to
be called the ‘Elementary Philosophy’, Fichte does not find Reinhold’s aim totally
out of order. Accordingly, we can understand the Wissenschaftslehre as Fichte’s own
attempt to develop a system, from a singular first principle, for deriving Kant’s views on a firm and certain footing. Yet, attempting to ground Kant’s philosophy, Fichte
also departs from it in some critical ways.
 
First, with regards to Fichte’s answer to a certain and universal first
principle, he tells us that ‘the I posits itself as an I’.156 For Fichte, this simple
statement has profound implications. Behind all thought is the presupposition that there is a unified self. In this way, Fichte’s first principle is not as ambitious as
Reinhold’s, which tells us that thought assumes a representational structure
 
155 Dan Breazeale and John Walsh, “Karl Leonhard Reinhold,” Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, April 30, 2003. https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/karl-reinhold/. 156 Friedrich Schlegel, a contemporary of Fichte’s, will go on to deny Fichte’s first principle while, at the same time, attempting to synthesize his system with Spinoza’s pantheism. 
 
461 requiring at least three things (an object being represented, a representation, and a
subject who that object is represented to). By contrast, Fichte’s account only
commits us to the view that every conscious thought implies a unified subject.
However, this subject is still very limited. It is not, as Descartes thought, that we have access to ourselves as continuously existing thinking things, but that, in each
thought, we posit a self. Importantly, we do not, at this point, know that there is a
continuous thinking self which ties together each consecutive thought. Instead, each
thought only requires the existence of a thinker for that thought. From this,
however, we can still work our way further back. Just as Kant had told us that the experience of thought demonstrates the prior knowledge of the categories, Fichte has
already attempted a transcendental argument to show that the experience of thought
demonstrates our own self-positing, but this, in turn, could only be possible given
even further positing before it.
 
The next step in Fichte’s transcendental argument is to point out that in
positing ourselves, we necessarily also posit limits to ourselves. After all, we can’t not
posit ourselves in thought, so we are at least limited in this way. What, then, does this
tell us? For Fichte, this reveals that the self is limited, and it must be limited by something. This other force, which limits us, is the world. Indeed, the world limits
our positing in a number of ways. For instance, when we see a pumpkin, we can’t
help but represent the pumpkin to ourselves, and we can’t help but represent it in
the ways that it demands of us. Try as we might, we can’t see the pumpkin as blue or ten-feet-tall. Of course, we can imagine it as such, but we can’t see it as such. This is
the way in which our freedom of positing is limited by the world, and it is the way by
which we are forced to confront the limitations of our own capacity for thought.
Notice that the world (as a limiting force on the freedom of thought) plays a very
similar role that the objects in and of themselves played for Kant. The key difference is that, for Fichte, we have no reason to claim that the objects exist independently of
the mind. Once again, Fichte is confined to a narrow lane in terms of what we can be
certain of, and therefore justified in positing. The force which limits our thought,
which makes us think of small orange pumpkins and not a big blue something else, is found within ourselves. All of the things we attribute object-ness to, and Kant would
claim exist independently of ourselves in the noumenal world, are ultimately just
 
462
expressions of the limits of our thought within our own minds.157 In this way, Fichte
is an absolute idealist; everything that exists is an extension of or expression of our
own minds. This mind is fundamentally divided between the free but limited self
(the I) and the limits on that self (the not-I). This brings together Reinhold and
Kant’s subject and object into a singular entity which we can call the absolute 
subject-object (sometimes called the ‘absolute I’, though we can see that things are
more complicated than that).158  
 
Karoline von Günderrode 
 
We have already seen, with Kant, an inward philosophical turn in Germany
during this period. In his view, many of the phenomena we see as natural and
external to ourselves (such as space and time) are actually produced in the mind. This means that, not only should we look at ourselves in order to understand much of
what is knowable to us, but also that the objects in and of themselves are forever out
of reach of our understanding. However, Kant’s seemingly inward facing
philosophical methodology of transcendental deduction is also taken up in the time after his writing by those who would seek to use it to return philosophy to the world.
This was visible to some degree in the work of Fichte, whose principle of
consciousness pushed us to accept the divided unity of the self and world, but this
tendency within German idealism will reach its fullest expression with German romanticism.
 
157 The role of the world in constraining our thoughts will be a certain theme for 19th and 20th century pragmatist philosophers, many of whom were deeply influenced by German idealism. More can be read about pragmatism and the influence of idealism on it in the “The Pragmatists” chapter.    
158 While many scholars take Fichte to have abandoned this view (which was quite popular) after leaving Jena, this interpretation has now fallen out of favor. Prominent Fichteans (that is, followers of Fichte), including the early 20th century American philosopher Ellen Bliss Talbot, have argued that there is considerable continuity between the two stages of Fichte’s career.   
 
463
Romanticism is a philosophical and artistic movement which puts human freedom, the natural world, and the past up as its highest ideals. The school of
German romanticism emerged as a reaction to the Enlightenment rationalism that
reached its high point in epistemology with the work of Kant and in aesthetics with the work of Baumgarten, Mendelssohn, and Lessing. For too long, in their view, art
and intellectual culture in Europe had sought to emulate the ancients and, as a result,
society had drifted too far towards an almost Platonic rejection of the world in favor
of the life of the mind. In the dominant place of reason, these new thinkers would
have emotion, in the dominant place of the mind they would have nature, and in the dominant place of political thought, they would have the individual seeking their
own meaning in accordance with their own freedom. This divide is, perhaps, seen
most clearly in the realm of aesthetics. The aesthetic rationalists denied the Kantian
and Humean claim that beauty is in the mind, and that judgements about it inherently involve sentiment. By contrast, Baumgarten held that aesthetic judgments
are just like any other rational judgements; when we say a painting is beautiful, we
are attributing the painting with a property in the same way and of a similar kind as
when we say that that creature over there, who we can call Jerimiah, is a bullfrog. This, from the perspective of the aesthetic rationalists, is just an intellectual
description of what is clearly visible within the physical world. This is exactly the
kind of attitude and approach that the romantics will reject, and, in Germany, they
will argue their case using the methodology and from the context of Kant.
 
While it is difficult to say exactly when German romanticism starts, or who
its first adherents were, some names do rise to the fore. Even before we arrive at the
figures who everyone regards as romantics, there are still those who are often called
‘proto romantics’ (in that they have some but not all of the characteristic features of
romanticism, that they were working just prior to the emergence of the romantics, and that they had a significant influence on the romantics). In the case of German
romanticism specifically, we can look to the so-called Sturm und Drang (or ‘storm
and stress’) movement. This school of artists and thinkers includes early figures like
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. That Goethe is now remembered primarily as a poet and not as a philosopher is probably a good testament to his romantic
tendencies. To the romantic (as was true for many ancients), this is a distinction
without a difference. Rather, the more emotionally salient form of poetry may be
 
464 more conducive to philosophical work than the more rationally organized and
reasoned form of prose that philosophers tend to use. This represents a larger shift,
and one endorsed by Goethe, that we should seek to reunify art, nature, science, and
philosophy, instead of treating them as separate (and sometimes competing) enterprises. What, then, does art contribute to this combined project for the Sturm
und Drang movement? Friedrich Schiller draws more from Kant, including from his framework for inquiry. In this case, Schiller argues that reflection on our own
experience of thought distinguishes theoretical from practical forms of reasoning,
and that art’s principal goodness is that it allows for ‘freedom in appearance’. When we engage with a work of art, we use the same faculty that we use in making
judgements about our actions to criticize our perceptions. What, exactly, this
consists of is a matter of scholarly debate, but it is at least a departure from Kant’s
views. While Kant did talk about the ‘free play’ of intuition and judgment in aesthetics, our claims about aesthetic goodness are still, ultimately, kinds of
predictions we make about the pleasure that other people are likely to feel when they
engage with a work. In this way, Kant’s theory of aesthetic value is a form of aesthetic
hedonism. By contrast, because he emphasizes freedom rather than pleasure, Schiller departs even further from the aesthetic rationalists and veers further in the direction
of the individual rather than the objective.159 It is clear that thinkers in Germany
during this time felt free to depart from Kant while, at the same time, feeling free to
use his own methods of transcendental deduction against him. One of the most radically different pictures which, nevertheless, still embodies this tendency, comes
from the poet and philosopher Karoline von Günderrode.
 
Günderrode was the first of six children born into a noble family in
Karlsruhe, on the German side of the modern French-German border. Despite her
noble lineage, Günderrode did not grow up in a wealthy environment, as her father passed away when she was still six years old, leaving the family without a source of
income. While little is known about her early life and years, we do know that she was
instructed in French and on the topic of literature by a tutor, and that she left
 
159 Among the other influential Sturm und Drang thinkers is Johann George Hamann. Hamann went even further in his criticisms of the rationalist tendencies of his own day, arguing that science and philosophy inevitably lead us to skepticism about the external world (whether in the form of Hume for the empiricists or Kant for the rationalists).  
 
465
Karlsruhe for Frankfurt at the age of 17, staying in a home established by a charitable
organization to house unwed women and widows. While there, she continued her
studies and developed a strong interest in and support for the French revolution. She
also met and befriended the Brentanos (being especially close with Bettina 
Brentano von-Arnim), a wealthy family of intellectuals in Frankfurt.160 It was through these friendships that Günderrode first encountered and later sought to
marry the wealthy Carl von Savigny as a means of leaving the convent at which she
was staying (a request he denied). It was at this point that Günderrode began
publishing her first works of poetry and philosophy under the more masculine pen name ‘Tian’. In the same year, she also began an affair with the significantly older
and married archeologist Georg Friedrich Creuzer. Creuzer took Günderrode’s
philosophical and literary ambitions seriously and introduced her to works of Indian
philosophy. As a result, Günderrode tried to convince him to leave his family behind and move with her to Russia. While he did eventually inform his wife that he would
be seeking a divorce, he equivocated and delayed the decision afterwards. When he
soon became ill, he instructed a friend to inform Günderrode that he would be
ending his relationship with her. Distraught, Günderrode waded out on the bank of the river Rhine and stabbed herself in the chest, dying at the young age of 26.
Despite the unfortunate circumstances surrounding her short life, Günderrode still
managed to leave a tremendous impact on both German philosophy and German
art. Beyond her original works of poetry, Günderrode was also frequently depicted or mentioned as a tragic icon within the Romantic tradition. However, here we will
be principally concerned with her philosophical thought.
 
While Günderrode did attach a philosophical text to her first publication,
Gedichte und Phantasien, much of what we know about her views about
metaphysics, aesthetics, and ethics come from analyzing her poetry itself. This is certainly not the first time that a philosopher has primarily used the medium of
poetry in order to communicate their views. For instance, we can go all the way back
 
160 Bettina Brentano, while most recognized as a writer, was a philosopher in her own right as well. Among her philosophical contributions was a feminist account of the newly emerging concept of artistic ‘genius’. On her view, genius is not a fixed trait of great individuals (historically attributed to male thinkers and artists) but a kind of force which can be transmitted and cultivated through loving relationships.  
 
466 to the Presocratic Xenophanes or the ancient Babylonian Theodicy to see some of the
earliest examples of this. This trend has also continued all the way up through to, at
least, the Aztec tlamatinime, who engaged in philosophical dialogue primarily
trhough spoken poetry (which was luckily eventually written down). What, then, does Günderrode’s poetry reveal about her views? At its most basic, Günderrode sees
the world as made up of tiny indivisible ‘elements’. However, these are not the same
elements that we know from the periodic table necessarily. Yet, like those elements,
these tiny constitutive bits are able to combine themselves in new and interesting
ways. Perhaps harkening back to the Presocratic Empedocles, the force drawing them into combination is love. The result of this view is that when we die, our
elements are dispersed into nature and recombined with other elements from other
things to create new objects, including new people. Yet, love is not a metaphor on
Günderrode’s view. For instance, when we as individuals feel attraction towards other people, we are feeling the pull of our respective elements, which are being
drawn together.161 Perhaps this is a consequence of our shared elemental history;
what is now a part of us and a part of them was once a whole and unified other. In
this way, Günderrode endorses a form of the doctrine of reincarnation, but it is not like that of classical Indian or Greek philosophy. While we don’t retain our
conscious memory across our many lives, we are able to go on and experience a
variety of modes of being in the world (whether as a carp, a tree, or as elements in
whole new people). We can call this her theory of metamorphosis.
 
This basic metaphysical picture reaches out into and informs Günderrode’s
account of political philosophy and aesthetics as well. As we have already seen,
Günderrode was an ardent supporter of the French revolution as it was happening.
Yet, for her, this was only natural. Since nature itself is constantly churning and
reinvigorating itself by dissolving entities and recombining the pieces in new and interesting ways, why should the same not be true of the state? The same elements
which make up a country (its people) should, if naturally compelled by love, be free
to dissolve and recombine in fruitful ways. With regards to aesthetics, Günderrode is
able to use her system to critique Kant’s. Recall that he saw the experience of the sublime as the exhaustion of our imaginative capacity by something in the world
 
161 A similar view was also seen in some works by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. 
 
467 outside of ourselves. However, if Günderrode is right about her elemental
metaphysics, then there is no such sharp boundary between the world and the self; it
is, in many ways, continuously made up of us and us of it. As such, the experience of
awe we feel in the situations that Kant describes as sublime are actually instances of
feeling our own true oneness with nature.162 To truly feel this oneness is, in some
ways, to accept the continuity between ourselves and the natural world, along with
our eventual return to and recombination within it.
 
Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling 
 
Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling was born in the small town of Leonberg outside of the city of Stuttgart in western Germany. His father was an
‘Orientalist’ professor (that is, one who teaches on the cultures and history of Asia),
and the young Schelling quickly followed in his father’s academic footsteps. He first attended Latin school, where he met and befriended the German romantic
Friedrich Hölderlin (who would later become an influential poet and philosopher in his own right) before going on to the protestant seminary his father was employed
in in the nearby town of Tübingen. There, Schelling made his second friend of note,
and a fellow German idealist philosopher, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel.163
Together, Schelling, Hegel, and Hölderlin would live as roommates during their
time in Tübingen. This period also saw Schelling’s interests move from the Lutheran
theology dominant in Germany at the time to broader questions of philosophy, as
around the time that he completed his doctorate (in theology), he also began to read the works of Kant and Fichte. After a brief stay on his own in Leipzig where he was
able to meet even more contemporary philosophers of note (including Friedrich
 
162 Notice the similarities between Günderrode’s discussion and 1) non-dualist accounts of the self in the Orthodox schools of Indian philosophy and 2) the denial of the self by the Buddhist school. This is no coincidence, as we know that Günderrode was familiar with classical Indian philosophy. This follows a larger trend of influence between classical Indian idealism and the emergence of idealism as the predominant position in Germany in the time after Kant.  
163 Hegel’s own life and views will be discussed at length later in this chapter. 
 
468
Schlegel), he was invited to work as an unpaid professor at the University of Jena at
the same time as Fichte.164 
 
While at Jena, Schelling was encouraged by Fichte to take up his own
Wissenschaftslehre, and to continue the tradition of transcendental philosophy
initiated under Kant. However, Schelling’s interests focused on the emerging trend away from the rationality obsessed Enlightenment thought of Kant and toward the
emerging German Romanticism movement. After some interpersonal drama
surrounding Schelling’s relationship to the family of Friedrich Schlegel, he soon left
Jena for Würzburg in the northern state of Bavaria in order to study medicine.165 This marked a tumultuous period in Schelling’s life, in which he ended his
friendships with Fichte and Hegel and began openly criticizing their views in print
(in the case of Fichte) and in the classroom (in the case of Hegel). This saw the
beginning of a public feud between Schelling and Hegel which would continue for the rest of their lives. Unable to feel at home in the Catholic-dominated Bavaria,
Schelling began to bounce around from Stuttgart to Munich and from Munich to
Berlin. It was during this final period in Berlin that Schelling cemented his
intellectual legacy. By this time, Hegel’s philosophy was dominant, and Schelling was seen by many younger philosophers as a force to be overcome, rather than as a figure
to endorse. Accordingly, we see the young Mikhail Bakunin (an influential Russian revolutionary and anarchist political philosopher) and Alexander von 
Humboldt (who argued for the inseparability of art and science) attending
Schelling’s Berlin lectures and engaging in a great deal of criticism of them.166 Yet,
despite their (mostly political) objections to his view, many of these figures still bear
 
164 This invitation came from none other than Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who was serving as prime minister of the state of Saxe-Weimar at the time. 165 This drama centered around Schlegel’s wife Caroline leaving him for the younger Schelling. While Caroline Schlegel-Schelling never published under her own name, she was a well-known intellectual force in German Romantic circles.  166 Also among those who attended and criticized Schelling’s lectures were Friedrich Engels (who famously co-authored a number of texts with Karl Marx) and Søren Kierkegaard (the ‘proto existentialist’ Christian philosopher). More can be read about both of these thinkers in the “19th Century Continental Philosophy” chapter. 
 
469 the influence of Schelling’s work, the legacy of which lived on beyond his death in
Switzerland in 1854.
 
Like many of the other thinkers in the period, to fully understand
Schelling’s philosophical contributions, we must go back to Kant. Recall that Kant’s
transcendental idealism told us that time and space are projections of our mind and not necessarily features of the external world. Meanwhile, Schelling looks around at
the emergence science of his day and sees cause for skepticism about this picture. For
one thing, as we saw with Kant’s quite popular works on the natural causes of
earthquakes, geology was just recently coming into its own as a science during this time. For the first time, humans were beginning to get a sense of how long the
natural world has existed, and this seemed to suggest that humans have only
occupied a tiny portion of it. Yet, if time has stretched back for eons beyond the
earliest humans, then how is time a product of our own mind? Rather, if nature is able to slowly, over vast swaths of time, build and tear down mountains and evolve
new species of life from older varieties, Schelling worries that Kant has ignored the
truly pressing question; the answer to which may give us a unified picture of the
mind and nature. That is, Kant’s transcendental deduction asks how the mind must be in order to present the world to us as it appears in phenomenal consciousness. By
contrast, Schelling wants to ask how the world must be in order to have allowed for
and produced a consciousness like our own. This is the essence of Schelling’s natural
philosophy.
 
In articulating his answer to this question, Schelling draws on the works of the German romantics Friedrich Hölderlin and Novalis (the pen name of Georg
Friedrich Philipp von Hardenberg). Recall that, for the absolute idealist, all there are
mental (that is, phenomenal) images. As such, while we have so far not brought up
this point, absolute idealism is a form of monism, or the view that there is only one underlying substance making up reality. The absolute idealist accepts this basic
premise of monism, that all things are united in kind, and specifies that the kind of
thing which reality is, is mental. However, as we saw with the earliest of classical
philosophy, this seems to raise the question of how there are so many seemingly different things if the reality is that there is only one. This is the problem of the one
and the many. Hölderlin’s answer is that, in the same way that we saw in some of the
Vedanta sub-schools of classical Indian philosophy, we should posit being itself as
 
470 the ultimate substance underlying reality and see the self and the ideas which make
up the world as parts of that unified being. Thus, the self and nature are both merely
attributes of being itself. Schelling develops this idea further with his theory of 
transitive being. Here, Schelling sees the natural world and ourselves as properties which can be attributed to the unified whole underlying reality. This being is, as
nature is for Günderrode, in a constantly evolving state of flux; the natural world is
not a lawlike machine (as the mechanical philosophy popular during the
enlightenment would have us believe) but a dynamic churning of activity (like the
processes of sedimentation and erosion now being described by the emerging science
of geology).167 
 
Just as Günderrode looked to the sublime within her dynamic metaphysics
as an opportunity to transcend Kant’s gulf between ourselves and the objects of the
world, Schelling will turn to art to fulfill the same role within his own theory. Here is
also where we can see the influence of Novalis. Novalis, like most of the romantics, saw philosophy, science, and art as a single continuous enterprise. The goal of this
project (which he refers to as Bildung, literally meaning ‘formation’ or ‘education’),
in Novalis’ view, is to come to an understanding of oneself as embedded in a particular social, historical, and natural context. Many of the philosophers we have
so far discussed have sought to study phenomena from a totally objective and
ahistorical point of view. Plato’s metaphysics isn’t a description of the concept as the
Greeks understood it, but an attempt to understand universal and permanent forms, which Plato takes to be graspable by anyone anywhere in the world and at any time.
By contrast, we have already seen the influence of history creeping in through the
work of Novalis and Schelling. To understand oneself and one’s own capacity for
judgment, we must (in Novalis’ view) seek to understand as many diverse points of
view as possible until the point at which one is able to understand the causes and limits of their own consciousness. Further, for Novalis, art represents a powerful tool
for accomplishing this goal.
 
With Novalis’ ideas in mind, we should recall Schelling’s initial question
and his answer to it. His primary concern was with the way that the natural world
 
167 In this way, Schelling can be thought of, like the Aztecs, as offering a process philosophy, rather than a substance philosophy. 
 
471 must be in order to produce minds like our own (capable of rational judgements,
deliberating, and knowledge). His answer is that our selves are properties of a
continuous unity of being which also includes the things we perceive. This
connection allows our minds to perceive and come to know outside objects. With this story in mind, we are now able to return to Kant’s initial inquiry. Kant had
concluded that the things in themselves stand outside of our understanding, but
with Schelling’s unified account of being, we may have found a workaround. While
Kant is right that our rational capacity is precluded from coming to direct knowledge
of the noumenal realm, this is an epistemic limit and not a metaphysical one. This is to say that the limitation is not because we simply occupy two different realms
separated by a massive gulf, but because rationality (and therefore science and
philosophy) is governed by the kinds of laws described by Leibniz (e.g., the principle
of sufficient reason, the law of noncontradiction, etc.). However, operating outside of these constraints may allow us to access what science and philosophy can’t allow.
In this way, art’s role in our unified quest for self-consciousness is made clear; it
allows us to access the absolute identity underlying the self and nature. The result
of this is that Schelling’s account of the goals and power of art are quite similar to Günderrode’s, even if they have two very different metaphysical pictures and,
therefore, ways of arriving at their views in aesthetics.
 
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel 
 
While we are still, in many ways, directly living within the continuing
project of the Enlightenment, the philosophy of Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel may represent the fullest and most confident expression of it. In the same way, Hegel
can be seen as one of the last major systematic philosophers. As the specialized fields
of knowledge which interact with topics in philosophy have grown larger and larger,
it has become more common for thinkers to narrow their philosophical ambitions to match, or to satisfy themselves with ever smaller and more practical goals. However,
this trend is not seen in the work of Hegel, who feels comfortable writing on the full
range of topics which have historically influenced philosophers, drawing
 
472 connections between these areas of research, and (all the while) being firmly
committed to the rationalist project which he inherited ultimately from Descartes.
Beyond this, his influence has reached far beyond the hallowed halls of the academy
and out into the realm of major world events. Indeed, interpreting Hegel’s work, and understanding its implications, has been historically divisive and has sometimes
spilled out into the political sphere. The two sides, each grappling with his legacy,
have come to be called left and right Hegelianism respectively. The consequences of
this debate have been so severe and profound that the 20th century American
philosopher Richard Rorty has said that the two sides “eventually sorted out their differences at a six-month-long seminar called ‘the Battle of Stalingrad’” (a reference
to fighting between the communist U.S.S.R. and Nazi Germany).168 
 
Hegel was born in Stuttgart to a well-to-do family. His father was an official
in the court of the Duke of Württemberg (the Duchy of which Stuttgart was the capital). While this social standing certainly benefited the young Hegel, by allowing
for his education in classics and emerging Enlightenment philosophy at the Royal
Highschool, his life was not without its own adversities. When Hegel was thirteen,
his family contracted a fever that took the life of his mother, and which nearly killed his father and himself. By eighteen, Hegel enrolled at the Tübinger Stift, the
protestant seminary where he met, befriended, and eventually lived with Hölderlin
and Schelling. The three friends were quite critical of the seminary environment,
which they saw as stifling, and they became deeply invested in the events unfolding in the French Revolution (with Hegel supporting the liberal Girondist
movement).169 While this young Hegel did imagine a life for himself in which his
philosophical interest and training could be used to the benefit of society, his
practical aim deterred him from engaging with much of the more theoretical Kantian
philosophy that occupied Hölderlin and Schelling.
 
Upon graduating, Hegel spent a brief stint bouncing between towns and
working as a private tutor in theology before moving to join Schelling at the

University of Jena. While this certainly raised Hegel’s philosophical profile, the
position itself was unsalaried despite his strongest attempts to secure such a position
at Jena or elsewhere. When Hegel’s son was born, outside of marriage due to an affair
with his landlord, Hegel’s financial needs pushed him to produce a work which could generate revenue. He also felt pushed to complete the project before the arrival
of Napoleon at Jena, not knowing what kinds of disruptions the war might bring.
This work culminated in the publication of his magnum opus, The Phenomenology 
of Spirit, which was completed the day before the arrival of Napoleon in Jena. Hegel
even reported that he had seen Napoleon himself doing reconnaissance on horseback in the city through his window the day prior. While the occupying French forces did
not destroy the University, Hegel still found it difficult to secure an income there.
This eventually pushed him to leave Jena for Bamburg, where he spent some time
publishing articles supportive of the French forces and trying in vain to obtain a stable paid University position. Finally, this persistence paid off, when, one year after
Napoleon’s defeat at Waterloo, Hegel was hired to a paid faculty position at the
University of Heidelberg, which he used to leapfrog into a position at the then-
dominant University of Berlin (a position which had remained vacant since the death of Fichte). Hegel would spend the remainder of his life, another thirteen years,
lecturing at Berlin. While he would not publish any new material during this time,
many of his lectures have since become public. In 1831, at the age of 61, Hegel left
the city during a breakout of cholera but reentered on the mistaken belief that the epidemic had passed. He died a month later from sickness, with his last words
apparently being “There was only one man who ever understood me, and even he
didn’t understand me.”170 
 
Hegel, like most of the German idealists, develops his own position in the
shadow of Kant. Also like many of his contemporaries, he is skeptical of Kant’s positing of unknowable noumenal objects, and deeply influenced by the new,
dynamic view of nature presented by natural sciences. In the first case, we should
recall that the eleventh of Kant’s twelve categories was ‘existence’. The problem for
this story, on Hegel's view, is that if existence is native to the mind and not
 
170 Heinrich Heine, “Zur Geschichte der Religion und Philosophie in Deutschland,” in Der Salon von H. Heine Volume: Zweiter Band (Volume 2) (Hamburg: Hoffmann und Campe, 1834), 221. 
 
474 necessarily the world, then we have no rational basis (like we saw with space and
time) for assuming that existence outside of the phenomenal realm is anything like
existence within it. Indeed, there might be nothing that corresponds to existence out
in the world at all. With this in mind, we have no reason to posit the existence of objects in the noumenal realm. Perhaps we could justify positing their existence if
they serve some explanatory purpose, even if we aren’t exactly sure they exist, but the
problem here is that, since they are unknowable in principle, they can’t do any work
in our understanding of the world. With that, Hegel takes himself to have shown the
superiority of absolute (metaphysical) idealism over Kant’s merely transcendental (epistemological) idealism.
 
With regards to the second point, the influence of a new, dynamic
understanding of nature, we should consider the example of geology once again.
Geology during this time was just beginning to tell us that mountains and canyons were not permanent fixtures, but things that evolved over time as a result of the
interactions of competing processes. This represents a larger shift during this time
period away from simply talking about regular and machine-like ‘laws of nature’ and.
instead, talk about ‘natural processes’ which actively shape and manipulate the environment and the creatures in it. We have already seen this influence in the work
of Schelling, but we can also find it in Hegel. This is principally because Hegel, like
Schelling, is interested in the history of the mind (even if this interest takes a
dramatic turn away from Schelling’s account and into new and unique territory). Here, Hegel’s concern is foremost with Kant’s claims that the categories of the mind
are universal. It may be that all of us, in our modern perspective, share these
concepts, but that doesn’t then mean that everyone all over the world has always
done so. Indeed, we know that various philosophers throughout history and across
cultures have had very different conceptions of causation, necessity, and existence (to name only three of Kant’s categories). Yet, if we could have had different categories
than we do, then we are right back where we started with knowledge of the
noumenal world. We couldn’t have knowledge of the things in and of themselves
because our perceptions of them were already influenced by concepts in the mind which we may not find in the world. Now, we are facing a different but still similar
problem. Ultimately, we want to know whether our concepts are an improvement
over those we used to have, but we can’t evaluate their truth independently of using
 
475 them. We might think that we have a better understanding of disease because the
older humor theory of disease could not tell us any of the stuff we now know about
germs. The issue is that we only think that germs are something that needs to be
explained because we have a concept of germs. From the perspective of the humor theorist of disease, our theory is just as bad at explaining facts about the humors (a
concept we now lack).
 
Where does all this leave us? Without some greater understanding and
without an objective standpoint to compare and evaluate systems of thought, we
may be forever siloed away, thinking that we are finally the generation or culture to have truly understood reality, but unable to prove it or to genuinely know. How,
then, do we step outside of our own perspective? For Hegel, the answer is that we
can take a historical perspective and analyze where our concepts came from and
where they are going. With this knowledge, we can then determine whether the movement from our old ways of thinking to the present represents progress rather
than mere change. Any attempt to derive laws of the world from a certain
philosophical perspective will assume the concepts of that perspective. However, we
can still come to understand the laws that govern the relations between philosophical systems. This is Hegel’s project; to give an account of the history of the practice of
thinking and, hopefully, thereby derive laws governing the development of thought.
Thus, Hegel is drawn to give a philosophy of history, or an attempt to understand
what history consists in, and to explain what forces drive historical developments.171 By the same token, just as we can understand Hegel as giving a philosophy of history,
we can also understand him as giving a history of philosophy, or rather, of what he
will call geist (or absolute/world ‘spirit’ or ‘mind’). For Hegel, geist can be thought
of as the totality of thought (as opposed to each person’s individual mind). While
this may tempt us to want to translate ‘geist’ as understanding or thought, this is still too static for Hegel. He is not interested in giving a history of our own present
 
171 The philosophy of history was also famously taken up as a topic by Hegel’s early modern Italian predecessor, Giambattista Vico, who argued that we could understand human nature by determining the laws of history and tracing our way back to humans as they originally were. In his view, the process of history is the realization of the potential of this human nature. 
 
476 understanding (as, perhaps, we are currently doing), but instead a history of the
practice of thought over and across all people.
 
We should notice that the idea that we can give an explanation of the forces
underlying history requires a particular and crucial assumption. To have a
philosophy of history first requires that history be the kind of thing that is conducive to our rational understanding. If, after all, there are no laws of history and there are
no reasons (as we understand them) behind the events of the world, then it is
difficult to imagine what an explanation would amount to. That this is a critical
assumption is not lost on Hegel. Indeed, he thinks that the unfolding of history is a rational, and ultimately teleological, process. However, if history is teleological, then
it operates according to some purpose which it works to fulfill. What then, is the
purpose of history? It is to bring about the absolute and perfect self-consciousness of
geist. The engine of history, the thing which compels us forward into the future, is that ultimately one day, if we are successful, we will witness the full maturation and
completion of the project of thought; that is, the realization of the ultimate truth.
This is the end towards which all historical events and all people, in their own way,
are working towards.
 
Further than this, however, we can also say that this increase in the self-
consciousness of geist also means greater and greater freedom. For instance, humans
used to be imprisoned, by our ignorance of the world, on planet Earth. However, by
coming to understand the laws at work in the universe, we now have the freedom to
travel beyond our own atmosphere. This pattern reoccurs everywhere around us; we now have abilities and options that no generation before us has had, giving us ever
more freedom to act in the world. This is, for Hegel, due to our acting as the eyes and
ears of the geist, allowing the practice of thinking to come into better self-
understanding. We can also see the same pattern within human affairs. In this way, Hegel holds, much like Kant, that there is a deep connection between free action,
rationality, and morality. As humans have come to have more and better knowledge,
we have also seen more and more freedom in the political realm. In Hegel’s view, to
take one example, we thought better of things like the divine right of kings and, by doing so, we have bought ourselves ever more freedom. Thus, history is a progressive
unfolding of the complete self-understanding of thought (a picture which reflects
our sense that the immoral and unjust ‘stand on the wrong side of history’). This in
 
477 the purpose towards which history works, the end of history. This theory, that
history is the story of the progress of the oppressed towards ever greater freedom and
equality, has come to be known as ‘Whig history’.
 
So, how do humans bring this about? For Hegel, we humans work to bring
the self-consciousness of geist about because we stand at the critical junction of spirit and matter; we inhabit the realm of thought, but also the actual world. This dual
position allows us to not only think, but to act causally through our actions (which
are themselves the product of thought). This is the sense in which we are uniquely
situated to actualize the geist in the world. Further, this same dual existence also allows us humans to synthesize the subjective (in having a private point of view) with
the objective. If the practice of thought is to become self-conscious, then that would
require the bringing together of the objective and the subjective; another role we are
able to fill. Yet, few of us probably feel like we are doing our part in this project (consciously or otherwise). Hegel recognizes this but argues that we actually are
contributing in our own little way, even if we don’t realize it and can’t see how it
helps. For us, our contributions occur and are meaningful in the context of a state.
Here, Hegel doesn’t just mean a government, but also the common culture and worldview of a region at a particular point in time. The practice of thought within
that state can be called the zeitgeist (or the ‘spirit of the time’, in contrast to the world-spirit). We are both the product of and the agents who actualize the zeitgeist
which we exist within.
 
Yet, occasionally, particular individuals can drag us, sometimes kicking and
screaming, into the future. These are what the Scottish philosopher Thomas Carlyle might call ‘great men of history’. According to Carlyle, history moves
forward on account of important and powerful people acting in order to shape the
world as they see fit. For instance, the story of the American Revolution and its causes is often told as a narrative about the ‘founding fathers’ as people and their
private reasons for acting as they did. In the same way, history classes are often filled
with stories about important kings and great military commanders, under the
assumption that what has happened in the past happened because of their decisions
in these critical moments. This view is sometimes called the great man theory of history. Hegel accounts for these people by saying that they merely play an outsized
role in bringing about a new zeitgeist. Rather than being the one ultimately
 
478 responsible for this dramatic shift in the course of history, these figures merely
uncover a new and inevitable future. Thus, instead of calling them the ‘great men of
history’ with all the credit that this title affords them as the authors of history, Hegel
simply calls them world-historical individuals, a name which better describes their actual contributions to the unfolding of events. We might still be tempted to
think that this distinction is a difference without a difference. However, Hegel’s
recasting of the ‘great men’ does have at least one significant effect. If we are merely
at the whims of ‘great men’, then these actors may use their power and influence for
good or for bad; there is no necessary progress. By contrast, if influential politicians and military commanders are merely uncovering the future which the geist reveals,
and the self-consciousness of geist leads to ever greater freedom, then Hegel is able to
preserve the progressive teleology of his philosophy of history.
 
The language used above, of the geist ‘revealing’ the future to the world-historical individual, may sound strange. After all, geist is absolute spirit, and relies
on humans as thinking matter to actualize it. If geist cannot act causally in the world,
how then does it reveal itself to individuals? For Hegel, geist makes itself known by
portioning off a part of itself (that is, a part of the practice of thought), and actualizing it so that it can then take that part up as the object of its reflection.
Undoubtedly, this sounds very mysterious. To illustrate, take the example of a
dominant political model within a state (e.g., monarchism, democracy, etc.). For
every political arrangement, we likely don’t think that it represents the final state of human affairs, in which total and universal freedom is achieved and perfect and
absolute knowledge is made possible. Instead, the zeitgeist of a state is merely a
partial gesture at a larger and deeper truth. For example, consider an absolute
monarchy, in which the king has total dominion over all affairs. This system invites a
particular view of what a legitimate government would look like. On the one hand, in offering up the divine right of kings as a justification for their rule, the king tacitly
admits that their rule is the kind of thing which needs justifying, that they need the
consent of the governed in order to operate. Even an ardent absolute monarchist like
Hobbes could see that. On the other hand, they have not offered any actual means of obtaining that consent. The limitations of this zeitgeist are only made available to us
when there is an actual and tangible monarchical state which we can interrogate.
Now, living in light of this seeming contradiction, a new system will emerge out of
 
479 the thesis, which incorporates what worked about it while also addressing these
contradictions. Namely, a constitutional monarchy.
 
For Hegel, the tensions at play within a zeitgeist, and the tendency for those
tensions to resolve themselves in the form of a new system, form the basis for
historical progress. Forms of life emerge out of geist as zeitgeists until their inner tensions cause them to implode into a new successor system one step closer to total
freedom and equality. This churning dynamic, in which systems evolve by working
out their own internal contradictions, can be called a dialectic (or the dialectical
method), and many other philosophers will develop their own dialectical theories.172
This is often explained or referenced to as Hegel’s theory of thesis-antithesis-synthesis, or the master-slave dialectic. According to this model, the zeitgeist is
understood as a thesis, while its contradictions are thought of as its antithesis.
Accordingly, the system which emerges to replace it is seen as the synthesis.  However, strictly speaking, this terminology is misleading. For one thing, it
originates in Fichte and not in Hegel, who never uses these terms. In addition, as we
have seen, a given thesis is brought down by its own contradictions. By calling these
‘an antithesis’, it sounds as if it were an external force that was in competition with the thesis, not as if the thesis is undergoing a process of inner struggle. Nevertheless,
the theory of thesis-antithesis-synthesis has become associated with Hegel’s dialectics
and, as such, the terminology is important to know in navigating the history of
philosophy.
 
In any event, what happened to absolute monarchism is not unique. In that case, a limited constitutional monarchy forms as a resolution emerges, and the
pattern continues until, ultimately, we arrive at the present day. You might be
tempted to say that our current liberal democracy is the best system available to us.
After all, it does seem to get a lot right about the value of the individual and the plurality of human freedom (especially when contrasted with its common
predecessor, absolute monarchy). Yet, in some ways, it may miss the degree to which
 
172 One of the most famous proponents of a dialectical theory is the German philosopher Karl Marx, who was himself a Hegelian in his younger years. With the development of his ‘dialectical materialism’, Marx claimed that Hegel had ‘set the dialectic on its head’, and that he was merely placing it the right way up again. The work of Karl Marx and what, exactly, this means will be discussed at length in the “19th Century Continental Philosophy” chapter.  
 
480 our autonomous individual freedoms are interrelated and mutually dependent.
Here, in our world, we see that there are tensions at the heart of our liberal
democracy. The founding fathers of the United States asserted simultaneously that
all men are created equal and that some could be bought and sold as property by others. Ultimately, in the same way that absolute monarchy would succumb to its
inner tensions, so too (presumably) will liberal democracy, producing something
freer and more equal still.
 
As we might expect, Hegel is more critical of romanticism than his other
fellow German idealists. If history represents the progress of rationality, then we have little reason to valorize the emotions or medieval life as the romantics would have us.
Yet, despite these differences, Hegel still has some romantic tendencies. Recall that
figures like Schelling and Günderrode saw a deep unity between the individual and
the natural world, and also saw a unique role for the arts in revealing this. Even as far back as Fichte we saw, with his theory of absolute subject-object, the romantic view
that the subjective and free self is bound up with the objective and constraining
world which we inhabit. Despite his more enlightenment and rationalism friendly
attitude, Hegel shares a similar view here. While Kant had grounded his moral philosophy in the freedom and autonomy of the individual, Hegel sees us as
necessarily existing within a state which places limits on us. We may be inclined to
think that absolute freedom would mean a state of complete anarchy, in which we
can do whatever we want. However, just as Schelling saw nature as both the limit on our freedom and the thing which makes it possible in the first place, Hegel feels
similarly about the state. Sure, we could be free in a ‘negative’ sense (that is, free from
the constraints of others) in an anarchist society, but the limiting power of the state,
beyond restraining us in certain ways, also allows for the development of freedom in
new and interesting ways. Just as the social enterprise of physics opened up our freedom to travel to the moon and beyond, the properly run state allows for ‘positive
freedoms’ only available through social cooperation.
 
For Hegel, an ethical person would inhabit a just state, which maximizes
their freedom, and operate from the complete understanding of their relationship to the state. This unity, between the objective state and the subjective individual, is the
highest ideal. In this way, we should aim for a cooperative relationship between the
state and the individual; if the state is properly run, then a good individual will exist
 
481 naturally within it, as opposed to fighting against its limiting force. Together, the just
state and its moral citizens work together to actualize the geist through history.
 
Interestingly, this claim serves as a bridge to his aesthetic theory. The
primary goal of establishing a new zeitgeist, from a historical perspective, is in
making some partial truth actual so that it can be taken up as an object of reflection. Hegel thinks that art is capable of doing the same thing: making truth concrete.
While much of modern art, even in Hegel’s time, is an expression of the inner life or
imagination of the artist (this is especially true for the work of the individuality-
loving romantics), art is still capable of expressing something universal and true. This expression, in turn, makes this truth tangible and concrete. In this way, art,
philosophy, politics, and culture more broadly are all tied up in the project of
actualizing the geist. This is made most explicit, for Hegel, in classical Greek
sculpture. For one thing, these sculptures (usually marble representations of humans) render the human spirit as concrete. We, as spectators, can then come in
and evaluate and reflect on the truth presented in the work in the same way that a
government’s concrete existence allows us to scrutinize the philosophy justifying it.
This is the greatest purpose which art can fulfill. Further, however, classical Greek sculptures also depict individuals as embodying the kind of unity between the
individual and their state that Hegel hopes for. In his view, modern art often
represents an expression of the angst of the artist and depicts people who are in
conflict with their own society or their situation within it. By contrast, ancient Greek sculptures depict heroes (sometimes world-historical individuals) who naturally
inhabit their position. No angst is visible on most of the statues, as they are properly
situated within the state and their individual will is a continuation of the freedom
that that state produces.
 
Thus, we can see that Hegel develops a theory of history, but in doing so also derives a political philosophy, a moral theory, and even an aesthetic theory as a
result.173 This is the sense in which he can be said to be a systematic philosopher. Yet,
if the tradition of German idealism is the playing out of ‘continental’ rationalism,
 
173 Later idealists will attempt to derive even more from Hegel’s system. For instance, the early 20th century British philosopher May Sinclair synthesized Hegel’s idealism with Freud’s psychoanalysis in order to develop a Hegelian philosophy of mind.  
 
482 then we may want to know how ‘British’ empiricism matures from the early modern
to the modern periods. This is, perhaps, best seen in the work of the utilitarians, who
we will turn to next.

484
The Utilitarians 
 
In many ways, Hegel can be seen as the fullest expression of rationalism and
its ideal logical endpoint. Thinkers like Yacob and Descartes had argued for the
power and the necessity of rationality and, finally, Hegel has rendered thinking itself
as the engine and the end of history. Not only ought we justify our beliefs, our claims to authority, and our commands in rationality, but we may have no choice in the
end. We are, after all, merely uncovering what the practice of thought reveals to us.
By the same token, we can see philosophy in the anglosphere world as following a
similar trajectory with regards to empiricism. If the modern period (as opposed to
the early modern period) is one in which rationalists push rationality further out in the direction of morality and politics, then it is also the period in which the
empiricists do the same with their scientific ambitions. What if the moral and
political domain was the proper subject of a science, rooted in human experience,
but focused on measurable facts which we can observe and test? In many ways, this is
the project which the utilitarians are invested in.
 
To understand utilitarianism as it emerged in the early nineteenth century,
we should first travel back to, at least, ancient China. It was there that we
encountered the moral and political thought of Mozi. Two major aspects of Mohist philosophy were 1) his doctrine of inclusive care, and 2) his state consequentialism.
The first aspect concerns how we regard one another. His view sets itself apart from
the Confucian emphasis on filial piety, by arguing that we ought to treat every
individual person in the same way. That is, trying to make your mom’s life easier or your worst enemies suffer should strike you as equivalent to making your mom
suffer and your worst enemy’s life easier. This is, at bottom, a demand for complete
and total impartiality in ethical life. With regards to state consequentialism, Mozi
told us that, when deciding between mutually exclusive actions, we ought to choose
 
485 the option that increases social order, material wealth, and the population of the
state. These three things are the measure of an action's goodness. For this reason,
Mozi’s theory can be called a consequentialist one, as it determines morality on the
basis of an action’s consequences. Utilitarianism, as a moral theory, is a form of consequentialism and, like Mohism, it demands impartiality from us. Where it
differs is in deciding which consequences matter.
 
Recall the Hellenistic Greek Cyrenaic and Epicurean schools. When we
discussed these views, we said that both were versions of hedonism. This is the view
that the only intrinsically valuable thing is pleasure. For the Cyrenaics, this was sensory pleasures (like eating chocolate cake and drinking fine wine) and for the
Epicureans it was simple pleasures of the mind (like friendship and studying
philosophy). What the hedonist tells us is that for anything of value, if we were to ask
why that thing is valuable, we could continue to ask this question of every answer offered until we arrived at a story about pleasure, at which point the story would
end. For instance, why is money valuable? You probably think that money is only
instrumentally valuable. It is great because it can get us what we want (whether that
is things or experiences); the minute that the money loses its value, it ceases to be valuable itself. Maybe, then, our answer to the question is that money is valuable
because it allows us to go on vacation and eat nice meals. Why, then, are these things
valuable? The hedonist will say that they are either valuable because of the pleasure
they give us, or they are instrumentally valuable in achieving something else which is, itself, only instrumentally valuable in achieving pleasure. Yet, when we ask what
makes pleasure valuable, the question seems slightly ridiculous. Pleasure is valuable
in and of itself, which is to say intrinsically. The utilitarian’s claim is that a good
theory of morality will go straight to the source and ask, simply, whether an action
produces pleasure or not. Pleasure, as it turns out, is the only consequence of any import. In this way, utilitarianism is a form of hedonism. Yet, in contrast to the
egoistic hedonism of the Cyrenaics and Epicureans, which focus on obtaining
pleasure for ourselves, the utilitarian will tell us that we ought to impartially
maximize pleasure for all those affected by our actions. In this way utilitarianism is the position in moral philosophy that combines hedonism (as a theory of value)
with consequentialism, arguing that morality is fundamentally about maximizing
pleasure and minimizing pain. If Kant’s moral philosophy can be said to center
 
486 around the principle of universalizability or the principle of humanity, utilitarianism
is the theory committed to the principle of utility. This tells us that an action is morally good if and only if it maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain. As we will see,
this rather simple theory may have profound implications about our moral obligations in the world.
 
Yet, the principle of utility only raises a further question about
utilitarianism. The theory is traditionally seen as a form of consequentialism (in
which the relevant consequences are pain and pleasure), but is it not also a form of
deontology? Recall that deontological theories are those which argue that morality is fundamentally about rules (e.g., the gold rule, the categorical imperative, etc.). Can’t
we say that utilitarians think morality is ultimately about one rule: the principle of
utility. In a sense, this is true. However, philosophers tend not to treat it as a
deontological theory because of how utilitarians justify their rule. What justifies the principle of utility is the consequences themselves (the pleasure and pain), not the
fact that the principle is the rule. We can contrast this with the theory of someone
like Kant. The principle of universalizability is followed for its own sake in Kant's
picture. Indeed, it is the fact that it is a rule which gives it its moral force; we assert a rule for others while, at the same time, treating ourselves as exceptions to it. The
categorical imperative is, for Kant, a rule of rationality. We must follow it because
the rule represents a constraint on our thinking. By contrast, the principle of utility is
not valuable to the utilitarian because it is a rule. Instead, it is only instrumentally valuable because of the pleasure and pain it produces when we act according to it.
This is the reason that philosophers tend to treat consequentialist theories as
different in kind from deontological theories despite their apparent rules. This
difference is also seen in another important distinction. We saw already that Kant
was very concerned with our intentions for acting. For instance, it is not morally praiseworthy for us to give to charity if we only do so in order to receive a tax break
or to look good to others. By contrast, the utilitarian would simply say that giving to
charity helps people. Feeding a dozen starving people produces more happiness than
one person going on vacation and so, all things considered, we ought to give to charity instead of going on vacation. It doesn’t matter, for the utilitarian, what our
reasons for maximizing happiness are, only that the consequences of our actions are
 
487 good. The prioritizing of consequences over intent is another key difference between
consequentialist theories and deontological theories.
 
Importantly, utilitarianism is a moral theory. As such, being a utilitarian
doesn’t necessarily tell us anything about a person’s metaphysical or epistemological
views. While some positions do tend to cluster across different philosophical topics (as we saw when most of the sentimentalists were also empiricists), they need not.
Yet, even if we can’t say that utilitarianism is the necessary conclusion of empiricism,
the two are quite compatible. Empiricism focuses all of human understanding on
what is given in or derived from experience; it casts philosophers as a kind of scientist, deducing truths from observation and data. Utilitarianism, as a
consequentialist theory, is also driven by data, and the data of morality (for the
utilitarian, units of pleasure and pain) is also provided by observation. While this all
may seem simple and straightforward, there is still a surprising amount of room for the development of new philosophical questions within this space and, as a result,
there will still be considerable disagreement between the different utilitarian
philosophers. This disagreement too, will be the topic of our investigation.
 
Jeremy Bentham 
 
The person often credited with being the first to formulate a systematic
utilitarian theory is Jeremy Bentham. Bentham was born to wealthy conservative parents in Houndsditch on the eastern side of central London. Like so many of the
figures we have discussed, the young Bentham was a child prodigy; reading a multi-
volume history of Britain as a toddler, beginning to study Latin by the age of three,
and having become a competent violinist by seven. In keeping with their own views, he was sent off to develop this natural talent at the conservative Westminster School.
Bentham resented the school's stifling and rigid environment, and the experience
would later motivate him to work on issues of educational reform. His efforts to
secure his own intellectual independence were thwarted when he arrived at Oxford University and found it to be just as conservative. In the time after Oxford, he
prepared for, and briefly worked in, a career in law. It was while working in this
 
488 capacity that Bentham encountered the work of philosophers like Claude Adrien
Helvétius and began to develop his own political and moral theories.174 He would
later eventually call this theory ‘utilitarianism’ based on a dream he had in which he
had become the founder of a philosophical sect by the same name. It was during this, as well, that Bentham anonymously published a criticism of the United States
Declaration of Independence on the grounds that the natural rights which formed
the basis of the document were absurd. Despite his skepticism of the argument the
document made, Bentham was still an ardent critic of colonialism generally, also
writing in defense of Australian and American independence in a work titled Emancipate your Colonies!
 
In his late thirties, Bentham traveled to Russia to visit his brother, who had
been in the employ of the royal family there. Bentham’s exposure, on this visit, to the
Russian criminal justice system moved him to develop a design for what he saw as a more humane prison. In this case, rather than strictly punishing prisoners and
keeping them in cruel living conditions, Bentham’s design was rooted in the idea that
prisoners could instead be constantly supervised, so as to prevent (rather than
punish) offenses. The resulting design involved cells arranged in a multistory circle around a central guard tower, allowing a single guard to constantly monitor every
cell. Bentham called this scheme a panopticon, and several were eventually built, albeit after Bentham’s lifetime, in Cuba, France, the Netherlands, and the United
States, along with a few other countries).175 Yet, Bentham tried in vain for three years to convince the Tsarina Catherine the Great of the panopticon’s merits. Upon his
return to England, he continued to attempt to influence policy and gather followers,
writing and working on issues of police reform, poverty, foreign policy, and
 
174 Helvétius’ focus on the complete equality of all humans and his work on educational reform (which we first encountered in our discussion of the rationalists, will also be seen in the work of Bentham. 
175 The panopticon’s place in the history of philosophy was cemented in the 20th century when the French philosopher Michel Foucault argued that it served as a metaphor for modern governance more generally. Foucault’s claim is that the shift away from harsh public punishments to a system of mass imprisonment which took place during the Enlightenment period was less the result of philosophical theorizing on human rights but a movement towards a more effective form of control in which all subjects (incarcerated or not) are constantly monitored and policed throughout their lives. 
 
489 women’s suffrage (to name a few). By the end of his life, he had received an
international reputation as a political thinker and commentator, befriending a
number of revolutionaries in France, Ireland, and Latin America. He was also quite
fond of animals and trained a cat, named Reverend Sir John Langbourne, to eat macaroni at the table with him. At the time of his death, he left behind tens of
thousands of pages of writings and one strange request. The fortune he had inherited
from his parents would be used to establish University College London, and his
mummified body would be displayed for educational reasons in a glass box on the
campus (a wish which remains fulfilled to this day). In addition to his philosophical views and the University he helped to create, Bentham’s legacy also includes his being
credited with coming up with the words “international”, “maximize”, and
“minimize”, as well as possibly being the first person to jog for health reasons.
 
Bentham’s criticism of the United States Declaration of Independence is quite telling in terms of his philosophy, and it also helps to illustrate the debt the
early utilitarians had to the empiricists which came before them. America’s founders
drew on the natural rights theories of empiricist thinkers like Locke and Hobbes to
make their case. However, by Bentham’s time, the idea of natural rights had fallen out of fashion in Britain. As we saw, Hume was quite skeptical of a natural right to
property. For Hume, these merely civil rights evolved due to practical considerations
involved in humans’ attempts to live together as a society. Bentham follows Hume in
his skepticism of the naturalness of rights, an idea he famously referred to as
“nonsense on stilts”.176 Yet, the reasoning which convinces him of this has an even
deeper sentimentalist streak. Recall that Hume was convinced that we could not
derive an ought from an is. While the is/ought problem is, on one level, a constraint
on how we must argue for moral claims, it is also a problem of practical reason.
This is the use of reason in order to decide how to act.
 
For Hume, facts and reason alone aren’t enough to motivate us to act in any
given way, we must also have some desire. This is the role that Hume posits for the
sentiments. Yet, if we want people to act justly and to comply with just laws, then we

490 may want to know how the moral sense works. That is, it may operate independently
of the laws of logic which govern our reasoning, but it must have some logic of its
own which can be understood by us and planned around. This is, in many ways,
Bentham’s first project, to provide an account of the logic of the will, and once again the sentimentalists will give him the tools to do just that. Remember that both
Hume and Grouchy both had similar stories about where our moral motivation
comes from. Take, for instance, Grouchy’s account. Here, we feel pleasure as infants
from nursing and, accordingly, we come to identify our mothers with the source of
pleasure. This generates in us a sense of positive regard towards her. This is eventually expanded out to others as we learn the ways in which our pleasure
depends on that of others. Bentham sees the sentimentalist picture of moral
psychology and begins to apply it to practical reason and ethics. The logic of the will
is that we seek out pleasure and avoid pain.177 We can then apply our faculty of reason to this pursuit in order to decide how we ought to act. The ultimate judge,
then, of how well we have reasoned and acted, is whether those actions really did
produce the pleasure and avoid the pain that we thought they might.
 
Yet, even though Bentham endorses psychological hedonism, arguing that we are only motivated by the pursuit of pleasure, it is still a nuanced view. It is not so
much that we are narrowly driven by obvious and simple pleasures. Rather, there are
a great many kinds of pleasure we can get, and Bentham goes to great pains to
categorize as many of them as he can. In the end, his list includes fourteen pleasures
and twelve pains. The fourteen pleasures are listed and described below:
 
1.   Sense: Pleasures which result directly from stimulating taste, touch,
smell, hearing, and sight, but also the pleasure of feeling healthy or
of satisfying one’s curiosity (e.g., eating a slice of lemon-pound
cake, hearing your favorite song, or the thrill of trying skydiving for
the first time, etc.).
 
177 As we can see, an interest in the non-rational or unconscious parts of the mind was in the air at the time, as the rationalist tradition also saw Fichte arguing for a mental limit on the rational and freely choosing part of the brain. Indeed, we are not far off from Sigmund Freud’s psychoanalytic theory of the unconscious, the early form of which endorses a kind of psychological hedonism as well, which Freud famously calls the ‘pleasure principle’.  
 
491
2.   Wealth: Pleasures which result from the security of possessing
things which we enjoy or need (e.g., buying a home or a new outfit,
etc.).
 
3. Skill: Pleasures which result from the exercise of an ability (e.g., 
climbing a mountain, learning to play the guitar, or meeting an
important deadline, etc.).
 
4. Amity: Pleasures which result from friendship and mutual regard 
(e.g., spending time with friends, earning the affection of someone
you admire, etc.).
 
5. Good Name: Pleasures which result from earning the respect of 
those around you or a positive reputation (e.g., winning an award,
having someone defend you in a disagreement, etc.).
 
6. Power: Pleasures which result from the ability to influence others 
and events (e.g., being able to call in favors on your behalf, etc.).
 
7. Piety: Pleasures which result from being reverent (e.g., praying, 
following the instructions of your parents, etc.).
 
8.   Benevolence: Pleasures which result from serving others (e.g.,
volunteering at a food bank, giving to someone in need, etc.).
 
9. Malevolence: Pleasures which result from the suffering of others 
(e.g., watching your enemies fail or suffer, etc.).
 
10. Memory: Pleasures which result from recalling previous pleasures
(e.g., reminiscing on time spent with a deceased grandparent,
nostalgia about the movies and music of your childhood, etc.).
 
11. Imagination: Pleasures which result from fantasizing (e.g.,
daydreaming about winning the Super Bowl, pretending to be a
rockstar alone in your bedroom as a child, imagining fighting
heroically at the Battle of Helm’s Deep, etc.).
 
12. Expectation: Pleasures which result from thinking about
anticipated future pleasures (e.g., joyfully watching the clock as it
counts down to summer break, thinking about the meal you intend
to eat tonight, etc.).
 
492
13. Association: Pleasures which result from the association of an
otherwise neutral thing with some other pleasurable thing. Here, as
an example, we can think about games of chance played for no
reward. According to Bentham, the pleasure we get from, for
instance, playing Bingo with no money on the line is mostly the
result of our associating gameplay with pleasures of skill or wealth.
Even though neither is exercised here, we may still feel pleasure
because it stimulates this association in our minds.
 
14. Relief: Pleasures which result from avoiding pain (e.g., barely
dodging a golf ball being hit in your direction, having a social plan
you were dreading canceled at the last minute).
 
The twelve pains are listed and described below:
 
1. Privation: Pains which result from reflecting on the fact that you 
are not currently feeling any kind of pleasure (e.g., wanting but not
having a slice of lemon-pound cake, wishing you could hear your
favorite song, etc.).
 
2. Sense: Pains which result from the sense faculties (e.g., hunger and 
thirst, smelling something disgusting, feeling exhausted or unwell,
etc.).
 
3. Awkwardness: Pains which result from a failed attempt to exercise 
an ability (e.g., losing a big race, struggling and failing to play a
difficult song on guitar, etc.).
 
4. Enmity: Pains which result from feuds and disputes (e.g., being in a 
fight with a friend, etc.).
 
5.   Ill Name: Pains which result from losing the respect of those
around you (e.g., your mother being disappointed in you,
embarrassing yourself in front of a large group of people, etc.).
 
6. Piety: Pains which result from a failure in the eyes of a Supreme 
Being (e.g., feeling guiling because of sinning, etc.).
 
7. Benevolence: Pains which result from sympathy or empathy at the 
pains of others (e.g., comforting a grieving friend, wincing when
you see someone injure themselves, etc.).
 
493
8.   Malevolence: Pains which result from seeing the pleasure of
someone you feel ill-will towards (e.g., watching your bully be
rewarded, seeing your rival be promoted at work, etc.).
 
9.   Memory: Pains which result from recalling previous pains (e.g.,
remembering the pain you felt in an injury, recalling your difficult
childhood, etc.).
 
10. Imagination: Pains which result from fantasizing (e.g., imagining
what an injury would feel like, thinking about your partner
possibly breaking up with you, etc.).
 
11. Expectation: Pains which result from thinking about anticipated
future pains (e.g., dreading a dentist appointment, thinking about
the punishment your parents will give you as a child, etc.).
 
12. Association: Pains which result from the association between an
otherwise neutral thing with something which is independently
painful. Here, we can think of feeling dread when a song comes on
that will remind you of an exe. While this may sound like a pain of
memory, you already felt dread before directly remembering the
painful thing. This dread is the result of an association between the
song and the memory.
 
Now, with an understanding of the kinds of things that we ought to consider in evaluating our actions in mind, we can look at the way in which Bentham
recommends that we reason morally. Here, Bentham endorses what we can call the
‘felicific calculus’ (also known as the ‘hedonic calculus’). Imagine deciding whether
to help a friend move or stay home and watch TV. Bentham suggests we look at both options and keep in mind any pleasures and pains choosing that course of action will
bring about for anyone affected. Importantly, we should not only consider our own
pleasure and pain but impartially consider the consequences for everyone involved,
including our friend. If we help our friend, we will suffer the sensory pains of exertion and, perhaps, the privation of not watching our favorite show. On the other
hand, we will also feel the pleasure of having both helped (benevolence) and spent
time with our friend (amity). We would also feel the accomplishment of completing
a task. By contrast, if we stay home, we will feel the sensory pleasures of watching TV and the relief of avoiding the sensory pains of carrying heavy things. However, not
 
494 going also means suffering the consequences of our friend being disappointed in us
(enmity or ill name). What Bentham recommends is that we analyze all of these
pleasures and pains according to seven criteria. These seven principles will help us
assign a numeric value to the amount of pleasure and pain both options will result
in.178 The seven principles are listed below:
 
1.   Intensity
2.   Duration
3.   Degree of Certainty






4.   Proximity or Remoteness
5.   Fecundity (its tendency to produce further pains or pleasures)
6.   Purity (whether it is fully pleasurable or painful or a mixture)
7.   Extent (the number of people who will feel it)
 
With these qualities in mind for each pleasure and pain, we simply need to
add up the pleasures and pains that one choice offers, with the pleasures being
positive numbers and the pains being negative, and see if the total is a greater or lesser
number than the total of the other choice. The right (that is, moral) choice, for
Bentham, is the one that produces the greatest net pleasure for the greatest number of stakeholders. This also extends beyond morality and into the realm of politics,
where the right laws will be those that produce the greatest happiness for the greatest
number of people.
 
Notice something very important about this picture. It is very likely that the world would be a less happy place if people were constantly tortured without a trial.
Surely the malevolent pleasure that the torturer gets from this is outweighed by the
extent, duration, and intensity of the sensory pains of the many people they torture.
However, for Bentham, this is not a matter of the torturer having violated the victim’s rights but, instead, is just the exercise of a rule of thumb. Since rights are
only instrumentally valuable in bringing about the happiest society (the one and
only good), there may be circumstances in which more people are better off if they
are violated. For instance, imagine a car accident in which the driver of one car is left
unconscious but otherwise healthy. However, the five passengers of the other car are
 
178 These hypothetical units of pleasure and pain are sometimes called ‘hedons’ or ‘utils’. 
 
495 in life-threatening condition. All of these people arrive to you, the doctor in an
emergency room, as patients. You know that all of the five passengers will die if they
do not each receive a transplant of a different vital organ (i.e., a heart for one, a
kidney for another, etc.). Luckily (or, perhaps, unluckily), you quickly realize that they are all matches for the unconscious driver of the other car. This now leaves you
with the choice of letting the five passengers die or quickly and painlessly stealing the
healthy driver’s vital organs while he is unconscious and thereby saving the lives of
five people. You might be tempted to say that you are violating the driver’s rights.
Yet, this seems to be a rare case in which violating his rights would produce the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. For this reason, Bentham’s
account of morality seems to say that the morally correct thing to do is to harvest the
organs of an otherwise healthy person. According to Bentham, all other things that
we value (justice, reality, etc.) are only instrumentally valuable and not intrinsically valuable. This means that we must always be willing to throw them out when greater
happiness is on the line. What Bentham can say in his defense is that, of course we
don’t want to do this; we feel bad for the poor innocent man and his grieving family.
However, this is only moving us to resist the conclusion because we aren’t properly attending to the suffering of the families of each of the other passengers. Do we
really, upon reflection, think that the suffering of the driver’s family is worth five
times the suffering of a passenger’s family, since there are five of them? In the end,
for Bentham, the truly moral and empathetic thing to do is to save the five at the expense of the one. The question of how to resolve this tension between the
principle of utility and the violation of someone’s rights is often called the problem of justice, and it remains a live philosophical question to this day.
 
John Stuart Mill 
 
Among the many pairs of philosophers whose lives and work are fundamentally intertwined together, few are as entangled as Jeremy Bentham and
John Stuart Mill. Mill was born to an academic father (who was schooled in the work of Thomas Reid at the University of Edinburgh), who prepared his young son
 
496 to follow in his footsteps. James Mill, John Stuart Mill’s father, was an acolyte of
Bentham’s and Bentham served as a personal patron of the family and its nine
children. As we might expect, James’ devotion to the views of Bentham meant that
he was deeply invested in a political project built around the economics of the Scottish enlightenment, liberalism without natural rights, and a progressive social
attitude focused on promoting human happiness. John Stuart Mill's education was
also rooted in the ideas of Bentham, as he was taught Greek starting at the age of
three and Latin beginning at eight. This instruction was only a small part of the
‘classical education’ he received in algebra, calculus, history, ancient Greek works, and the emerging science of the day. By the time that Mill turned fifteen, he was
already engaged in intensive writing on politics and philosophy while managing the
education of his younger siblings. While this did wonders for his growing mind, the
pressure that his father placed on him also resulted in a major period of depression at a young age. By his own estimation, the focus on calculation and rationality that
Bentham and his father had promoted had left him unable to process his own
emotions well; a problem which he also claimed to have at least partially resolved by
reading poetry. In turn, Mill would devote himself to the project of synthesizing the ideas of Bentham with the insights of poets like Samuel Coleridge.
 
Beginning at the age of seventeen, Mill took up employment as a colonial
administrator for the East India Company, and handled correspondence and
political matters between the company, the British government, and the so-called ‘princely states’ of India not yet directly governed by Britain. He would remain in
this role, though being promoted a number of times, for the next 35 years. It was
after roughly a decade of this work that he met Harriet Taylor (born Harriet Hardy),
who had married the pharmacist John Taylor around six years prior. The two
immediately admired one another’s intellects and became close friends. However, due to norms of propriety in Victorian England, it would be seen as uncouth for the
two to spend much time together alone. John Taylor eventually reached a deal with
John Stuart Mill according to which he would be permitted to see her under specific
circumstances, only at specific locations, and only when John Taylor would not be around. While it is believed that their relationship was primarily one of friendship
(even if there was deep and unrealized romantic longing), when John Taylor died,
(eighteen years after Mill first met the Taylors) it would only be another two years
 
497 before Harriet Taylor married Mill. As Mill continued to write, she would remain a
constant companion and a profound intellectual influence on him until her death
seven years later, even co-authoring works together with him (though she often did
not get credit for her work).179 After her death, Mill stood for election as a member of Parliament, serving three years as a member of the Liberal Party. In Parliament, he
advocated to improve the living conditions of the Irish (who Britain controlled and
subjugated), promoted the cause of labor unions, defended the continued use of the
death penalty, and became the first sitting member of Parliament to call for
women’s’ suffrage.
 
Beyond Bentham and Coleridge, another major influence on Mill’s thought
was his French contemporary Auguste Comte. Like Bentham, Comte also
endeavored to create a science. However, where Bentham wanted to explain the
behavior of individuals, Comte sought to explain the behavior of society. This difference is reflected in the resulting theories of the mind that the two thinkers put
forward. As we have already seen, Bentham followed many of his sentimentalist
predecessors in endorsing psychological hedonism, or the view that all human action
aims at the attainment of pleasure or the avoidance of pain. This apparent observation then served to ground his logic of the mind. By contrast, Comte not
only argued that we can act from a place of genuine altruism for others (even when it
might give us pain to do so), but that altruism was the highest and best motivation
that we could have, and egoistic hedonism is the lowest human motivation. In his view, a proper ‘social physics’ would have to reflect the full range of human
motivations, and this means it must recognize the pro-social nature of our behavior.
Accordingly, he named his own science ‘sociology’, and he played a major role in
establishing the modern field which continues to bear that name.180 
 
In this way, Mill’s synthesis brings together the consequentialism of Bentham with the broader and more socially oriented account of human
 
179 Harriet Taylor Mill’s life and work as a philosopher is the subject of the next section of this chapter.  
180 Importantly, Comte was not the first sociologist. The Tunisian-born philosopher Ibn Khaldun (a contemporary of Catherine of Siena) is widely, though not universally, regarded as the ‘father of sociology’, and thinkers as far back as Kongzi have worked on theories of social cohesion (now, perhaps, in the purview of sociology).  
 
498 motivations that can be found in the work of Comte. While Mill remains, like his
utilitarian and sentimentalist predecessors, a psychological and moral hedonist, his
view of pleasures and pains is greatly expanded from the way that Bentham or other
hedonists thought about happiness. Mill notices a potential problem with these more basic accounts; if generating pleasure and avoiding pain is the moral measure of
all things, why not simply focus our efforts on easily attainable and simple pleasures?
Why bother struggling to climb Mount Everest when we could just as easily eat a
slice of chocolate cake? In Mill’s view, there is clearly something deficient about the
life spent on the couch watching movies and eating gummy candies, and the person who would do this clearly improves the quality of their life by having bigger, more
enriching projects. While Bentham could account for many of these intuitions by
pointing to the fact that these more enriching projects tend to produce happiness for
other people too and not just oneself (e.g., writing a novel or playing the violin), the same can’t be said for climbing Mount Everest or reading The Brothers Karamazov.
What can a proper hedonist say to someone who prefers to lay around over, say,
thinking about philosophy (a problem Mill colorfully describes by asking whether
“it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates
dissatisfied than a fool satisfied?”181
 
Mill’s solution to this problem is to distinguish between what he calls
higher and lower pleasures. These are pleasures which don’t differ in quantity but
do differ in quality. The lower pleasures are simple and could be obtained by any animal. For instance, Bentham’s ‘sensory’ pleasures would count as low pleasures for
Mill. Meanwhile, pleasures which can only be obtained by humans, such as reading
or writing a novel, studying philosophy, or engaging in deep conversation with
friends, are higher pleasures. The higher pleasures are, for Mill, more valuable all
things considered. Notice that while Bentham did discuss pleasures beyond the sensory, they were not inherently better than the happiness we get from sight, taste,
and touch. In the end, on Bentham’s account, we must use the same seven principles
to evaluate all of the different kinds of pleasure. It may well be that the sensory
pleasures tend to be weaker on account of their being fleeting and only giving pleasure to us, but this runs into problems at scale. For Bentham, there must surely
 
181 John Stuart Mill, Utilitarianism, Fourth Edition (London: Longmans, Green, and Co., 1871), 14.  
 
499 be some number (even if it is unreasonably high) of pull and peel Twizzlers which
could produce more happiness if they were eaten than the amount that we would get
from the benevolent pleasure of saving someone’s life. Benevolence may give us a
better bang for our buck in terms of the time we spend, but that will ultimately be a factual question, and we are left with no resources to argue against someone if they
get more out of the Twizzlers. However, Mill has given us the resources to say that
the higher pleasures are different in quality, and therefore better in kind.
Unfortunately, resolving exactly how to relate higher and lower pleasures to one
another is an ongoing project for Mill’s interpreters.
 
Yet, while Mill’s distinction does, in principle, counter our initial concerns,
the fact that he is still, at the end of the day, a hedonist means that other problems
remain. Just as Bentham can’t account for justice being independently valuable (and
only instrumentally valuable insofar as it promotes overall pleasure), Mill’s theory can’t account for the value of reality itself. Both thinkers, by endorsing hedonism,
turn the question of value inward; something is valuable from our own interior
perspective and because it produces pleasure within us, all else being equal. To
illustrate the problem raised by this fact, consider a thought experiment called the
experience machine, developed by the 20th century American philosopher Robert 
Nozick. Imagine that, in a science fiction world, we have developed the technology to perfectly simulate real life within a machine. While you lay motionless in the
machine, you could have the complete experience of eating the most delicious foods, being a famous actor, or anything else you’ve always wanted. In light of this, you can
now choose whether to live a perfect life, with maximal pleasure and minimal pain,
in the machine, or to continue on in your normal everyday life. Because the
simulation gives you real pleasure (even though you don’t actually eat the steak or
win an Oscar), it seems like the hedonist should advise everyone to get inside the machine. If you wanted the higher pleasures that Mill discussed, the machine could,
after all, still be programmed to give you a life of studying philosophy and struggling
to climb Mount Everest. Yet, many will not want to get in the machine; they don’t
want to experience a simulation of climbing Mount Everest, they want to really do it! In this way, hedonism seems to render reality itself only instrumentally valuable in as
much as it tends to lead to greater happiness. The moment that the simulation
produces more pleasure, however, we ought to throw reality out the window.

Harriet Taylor Mill 
 
We have already seen that Harriet Taylor Mill, John Stuart Mill’s eventual wife, was a philosopher in her own right. Her contributions to the field
generally come in two forms: her individually authored works and the works she co-
authored with her husband. Unfortunately, many of these co-authored works did
not, and still do not, bear her name. Because of the controversy surrounding their relationship while she was married to John Taylor, Harriet Taylor Mill appears (in
her correspondence with John) to not wish to draw attention by having her name on
those works. Yet, it is clear from John’s autobiography and their correspondence that
some of his most major works are as much a product of her mind as well (though the exact breakdown of contributions is still a matter of scholarly debate). On the other
hand, she did publish some of her own works and began doing so prior to meeting
John Stuart Mill. While many of these early texts were works of poetry or history
published anonymously, her established reputation as an advocate of social reform and for the rights for women, along with John’s, was the impetus for their meeting in
the first place (an encounter set up by a mutual friend).
 
Of all of the single-authored texts that Harriet Taylor Mill wrote, “The
Enfranchisement of Women” stands out as one of the most influential and
important.182 As the name suggests, her primary aim is to argue for the political and
economic rights of women. However, as we have already seen, discussions of rights
are not normally at home in utilitarianism, as, according to the view, rights are only
good insofar as they promote happiness and not in and of themselves. Yet, while
Bentham referred to rights as ‘nonsense on stilts’, he was specifically talking about natural rights, not civil rights. It may well be that having political rights does
promote happiness and, for that reason, we ought to expand them. The difference is
that natural rights theorists will argue that we should have these political rights
because we are owed them by nature. By contrast, a utilitarian defense of rights must argue that the world (or the country in question) would be better off if we granted
them. This is precisely what Mill does. One of the primary arguments she gives tells
 
182 Some scholars believe that John Stuart Mill also had a hand in the writing of this work, but that view has fallen out of favor in more recent years. 
 
501 us that there are two negative social consequences which could be countered by
expanding the rights of women. First, and most obviously, by excluding women
from participating in social and political life, society restricts their interests as well.
While there is a straightforward claim here about the need to allow women to flourish and develop other interests, this also has another consequence for men. Mill
argues that because women are only able to take care of the family and the home in
her time, women can only influence their husbands towards that end as well. While
men are permitted, in a misogynistic society, to care about the public good, women
in that society are limited to caring about their own household. To the extent that this is true, it means that all married men face pressure and influence from their
wives to act towards the benefit of their own families. By contrast, if women and
men were regarded equally, both parties could develop broader interests and
promote them. In this way, subjugating women makes men greedier and produces a
political life in which fewer, more self-interested, voters participate.183 
 
Beyond this, Mill points out a contradiction at the heart of the broader
liberal Enlightenment movement. On the one hand, British society at the time had
moved toward economic liberalization (as we saw from the influence of Adam Smith
and the French physiocrat school).184 Yet, none of this economic liberalism had come
for the other half of the population. Women, being forced to work as housewives
and mothers for their husbands, had no choice of employment on the market. This
means that men effectively have a ‘monopsony’ on the labor of women. When, for any given market, there is only one seller of a good, we call that a monopoly.
Without competition from rival businesses, businesses are free to charge whatever
they want to customers and provide low quality products. In the same way, a
monopsony occurs when there is only one buyer of a particular good in a market.
While, on the face of it, women are not permitted to work in 19th century Britain, Mill argues that they do actually work, they can just only sell their labor to their
 
183 By contrast, the Irish utilitarian philosopher Anna Doyle Wheeler’s argument for the rights of women is much more direct, explaining the exact pleasures denied and pains inflicted on women by their social condition.  
184 Mill was not alone in arguing that Enlightenment liberalism entailed feminism. The American philosopher and feminist activist Judith Sargent Murray argued, similarly, that the principles underlying the American Revolution also require the educational rights of women.  
 
502 husbands in order to work as housewives. The result of this arrangement is a weak
labor market for women. If women were permitted to get employment outside of
marriage, then they could negotiate for better wages by seeking employment
elsewhere. This means that the same logic encouraging the British government to liberalize its economy in other ways also promotes expanding the working rights of
women as well.185
 
Finally, in terms of Mill’s collaborations with her husband, On Liberty
stands out as especially influential. As we have seen, despite their skepticism about
natural rights, utilitarians (including Mill) see themselves as liberal political reformers. In this way, On Liberty is a work of liberal social and political theory
arguing for the importance of freedom of speech. In this case, the Mills argue for the
harm principle. This tells us that we ought only to restrict the political rights of
individuals if it is to prevent them harming other people. In essence, this is the utilitarian position on rights in general. While we have already discussed the fact that
utilitarians must be willing to throw out someone’s rights if it leads to greater
happiness, the harm principle points out that that is the only real justification for
violating these rights because of their enormous social benefit. While we may not like everything that someone says, the Mills argue that we can only restrict their freedom
to say those things if it is a matter of public safety (e.g., someone yelling “burn their
house down” as part of an angry mob gathered around someone’s house). Perhaps
more interestingly, the Mills even think there is an important social utility in allowing people to say false things. While we might recognize that we are not
infallible, and ought to allow differing opinions because we could be wrong, On 
Liberty argues that we should allow falsehoods to be said even when we actually do
know they are false. The benefit of freedom of speech in these cases is that hearing
arguments for a falsehood keeps the truth a ‘living truth’. When only the truth is said that truth becomes a kind of dogma. We do know the truth, but we can’t defend
 
185 The broad economic implications of this argument go well beyond many of Mill’s contemporaries. For instance, the American utilitarian philosopher Catherine Beecher had argued, just eleven years prior in 1841, that women’s natural abilities as domestic caretakers make them better equipped to work as educators than men. On the basis of this, Beecher concludes that, not only should society allow women to work in the profession, but that it is the superior arrangement to men doing it. By contrast, Mill’s argument tells us that women should be allowed to work in whatever occupation they can sell their labor in.   
 
503 why it is true. While this may be fine in the short term, it makes our society more
vulnerable. In the event that someone eventually gets away with saying the other
view, those who hear it aren’t prepared to argue against it. In this way, freedom of
speech works as a kind of immune system for our political life, giving us small doses of dangerous ideas so that we can defend ourselves from them when conditions are
more dire.
 
Henry Sidgwick & E.E. Constance Jones 
 
After Bentham and Mill, the title of the next most influential utilitarian
from this period passes to Henry Sidgwick. Sidgwick was born in the town of
Skipton in the northern English county of Yorkshire. His father, the headmaster of a grammar school, died while the young Henry was only three, and little of note
happened in his life in the time between his father’s death and his departure for
school at the prestigious boarding school Rugby (birthplace of the game which
shares its name). His family was and would remain influential and well-connected in British intellectual circles (with his brother-in-law eventually serving as Archbishop
of Canterbury), and Sidgwick was able to use his time at Rugby to secure his
acceptance to Trinity College in Cambridge. There, Sidgwick was an accomplished
student on a wide range of topics, holding a number of titles and winning more than a few awards, and moving immediately into a position as a lecturer upon graduation.
This role saw him teach classics as well as moral philosophy for some time before he
concluded that he could no longer endorse the tenets of the Church of England
(something expected of a moral philosophy instructor) and forfeit a fellowship. While he did remain as a lecturer at the college, his newfound intellectual freedom in
the domain of moral philosophy opened up an opportunity for him to develop his
views further. The culmination of this was the publication of his incredibly
influential The Methods of Ethics. This work helped to secure Sidgwick a reputation within the broader British intellectual imagination outside of academia and, when
the religious requirements were finally removed several years later, he was reinstated
into his fellowship in moral philosophy. His time at Cambridge, where he would
 
504 remain for the duration of his career, was characterized by a mixed record, as far as
living up to the reformist ideals of his fellow utilitarians goes. On the one hand,
Sidgwick was a strident supporter of higher education for women, helping to found
the first women-only college at Cambridge alongside the suffragist Millicent Garrett Fawcett. He also worked in a number of ways to expand access to education at the
University to members of the working class. On the other hand, Sidgwick would also
eventually break away from his fellow liberals to oppose Irish political self-
determination.
 
Chief among the major contributions Sidgwick makes in The Method of Ethics are his discussions of the role of beliefs in moral action and practical reason. In
terms of the first contribution, Sidgwick concerns himself with clarifying what,
exactly, utilitarianism demands of us given that we don’t have full and perfect
knowledge of the world. To use an example, let’s return to the classic trolley problem. Imagine that you are standing nearby a track and within reach of a lever
which can determine whether trollies coming down the track go off to the left or
right. As the lever is currently set, any trollies that come by will follow the tracks to
the right. Incidentally, you can see one quickly coming towards you now. Unfortunately, if the trolley is not diverted from the right track, it will hit and kill
five workers who are standing on the track. You try to signal to them to move (and to
the trolley driver to stop), but you have no such luck. You quickly realize that the
only way of preventing their deaths is if you decide to flip the lever so that the trolley goes down the left track. The problem is that doing so would send it in the direction
of another, single, person standing there. Even more unfortunately, this person is
also out of earshot and will die if you decide to flip the lever. The choice you are
ultimately left with is one of leaving the lever as it is and letting five people die or
flipping the lever and sending the trolley to kill one person instead.
 
On the face of it, this is an easy question to answer for the utilitarian. If we
are trying to maximize happiness and minimize suffering, then the suffering and
happiness of five people must surely outweigh that of a single person. It is, after all,
one of the chief merits of the theory that it regards the interests of all people the same. However, as is generally true in life, things are more complicated than they
seem. Unbeknownst to you, the one person standing on the left side of the tracks is a
promising young medical researcher. If they are allowed to live out the remainder of
 
505 their life, they will go on to cure a number of tropical diseases, saving the lives of
millions. While someone will still eventually discover these cures in the event of their
early death, it will not be before the additional deaths of several million humans. On
the other side, and equally unbeknownst to you, one of the five people standing on the right track is a burgeoning serial killer. While they have not yet killed another
human, they are currently getting a taste for violence by practicing on animals. In a
world in which they go on living, they will kill somewhere between 23 and 26
innocent people. Thus, if we count the secondary effects of your actions, saving the
five and killing the one will actually produce many orders of magnitude more suffering in the world than simply saving the one.
 
What should a utilitarian say in this case? Of course, at the time of your
choice, you had no idea what the possible downstream consequences of your actions
could be, and, from your perspective, you made the choice that everyone would (given limited knowledge) expect to produce the greatest possible happiness for the
greatest number of people. Yet, imagine that we are now living in the world in which
you have saved the life of a serial killer at the expense of some millions of people
suffering from tropical diseases; should we praise you for having fulfilled your moral duty according to utilitarianism? Surely, in light of what we know now, you didn’t
actually act so as to maximize happiness in the world. This seems to raise an
important question about the nature of the theory; are we obligated to maximize
happiness from an objective point of view or just to act in the way that a reasonable person would expect to maximize happiness? On this question, utilitarian theorists
are divided. On the one hand, the view is supposed to be a form of consequentialism,
and the thing which sets consequentialists apart from deontologists is the fact that
consequentialists think the rule of maximizing good consequences is good because of
its consequences, not because it is a rule. The problem is that if acting in a morally good way, for utilitarians, doesn’t necessarily mean acting to produce the best
consequences, then in what sense is it actually a form of consequentialism? On the
other side of the debate, we might simply think that it is strange and wrong to be
blamed for something that we, nor anyone else, could have expected to happen as a result of our actions. Yet, notice that this is already beginning to sound like a form of
deontology, as we are saying that we clearly intended to produce the greatest
happiness for the greatest number of people, and that is what should matter morally.
 
506
This discussion points us towards another major debate within
utilitarianism; that between act and rule utilitarians. Act utilitarianism tells us that we must always perform the action which maximizes overall happiness and
minimizes overall suffering. Act utilitarianism is widely regarded as the view of those
thinkers we have already discussed. By contrast, rule utilitarianism is the position that we ought to follow the rules which tend to maximize overall happiness and
minimize suffering.186 While this position does sound like a form of deontology,
because of its focus on following moral rules, it is still a kind of consequentialism
because the rules themselves are only valuable insofar as they actually do tend to maximize good consequences over time (and are not valuable for their own sake).
The person who thinks we were right to pull the lever even if it turns out bad for
reasons we couldn’t have anticipated can appeal to rule utilitarianism to make their
case. The rule you followed in saving the five over the one does tend to produce the best results, it just didn’t this time. As such, you were right to follow it and should
not be punished. Yet, despite the compatibility between expected and rule
utilitarianism, there’s no reason why you couldn’t combine these various forms of
utilitarianism in a number of different ways.
 
For what it is worth, Sidgwick’s answer to these problems is not to endorse
either side, but to find a middle way through the debate. In his view, the issue of
whether we did the ‘right thing’ is really a matter of ambiguity in our language.
Sometimes we mean ‘right’ to mean ‘correct’ and sometimes we say ‘right’ to mean ‘morally correct’. Here, Sidgwick tells us that the ‘correct’ action is one which
 
186 Interestingly, it may turn out that acting with the thought of maximizing happiness (that is, as if utilitarianism is true) may not produce the best consequences. It may turn out that Kantianism, though it doesn’t care about these things, actually produces the best outcome. Accordingly, one could be a rule utilitarian with regards to what makes the good good and a Kantian in terms of how we ought to think about morality in our day to day lives. This is a similar sort of problem to one raised by Sidgwick called the paradox of hedonism. Here, Sidgwick points out that it may be true that our own pleasure is the ultimate judge of what is good (that is, that egoistic hedonism is true), but that acting selfishly to try to get pleasure is a bad way of actually getting it. This paradox then serves as a problem for egoistic hedonism. Beyond this, Sidgwick makes the further claim, that coming to see utilitarianism as true might make people generally less happy. Yet, if this is right, then publicizing the view could be immoral by its own standards. Accordingly, we may find ourselves in a situation in which philosophers should keep the truth of the theory a secret from the public.  
 
507 actually produces the best possible outcome. We can think of this like the correct
answer for a quiz question. After we have completed the quiz, we can use the correct
answers on the key as an objective point of comparison against the answers we gave
and, all things considered, selecting the correct answer is the optimal choice. By contrast, imagine that you were given the wrong numbers for your math problem. In
this case, it might be possible for you to satisfy the spirit of the exam, and give an
answer that is well-reasoned from your incomplete and faulty data, even if the
correct answer is out of reach. If we really want to judge whether you know the
mathematics, it seems that your ability to correctly perform the right procedure for the problem is what we are after, even if it doesn’t produce the answer the test-giver
was looking for. This is the sense in which doing the action that you expect to
produce the best results is ‘morally correct’. Thus, there is a limited sense in which
both sides of the debate are right. More importantly, however, we can see that this is not an issue with utilitarianism as a moral theory, but a broader issue to do with
reasoning with faulty data. In that way, Sidgwick is able to avoid the problem. This
position can be called dual consequentialism, because it contains elements of both
sides of the debate within consequentialism.
 
Sidgwick’s other major contribution, his discussion of practical reason, is,
perhaps, best understood in the context of his student E.E. Constance Jones (Emily Elizabeth Constance Jones). She was born in the small town of Llagaron in Wales,
but spent much of her early childhood in Cape Town, South Africa, where she
studied with a private tutor. This allowed Jones to become fluent in both German and French from childhood, and also secured her admission into the all-women’s
Girton College at Cambridge University, which had been founded just six years
prior. Despite excelling in academics, her college education faced constant
interruption, as she was forced to accommodate the efforts made by her family to prioritize the education of her brothers. This tendency was made worse by the fact
that she was one of ten children. Yet, despite these challenges, she did eventually
complete a degree specializing in ethics and supervised by Henry Sidgwick. Sidgwick
also took Jones up as his research assistant, offering her a job completing a translation of a work by the German idealist Hermann Lotze and also editing several of
Sidgwick’s own books. This eventually allowed her to take up a job teaching at
Girton, a role which saw her write a number of books on logic, philosophy of mind,
 
508 and ethics. In spite of her productivity, Jones only stayed in this position for thirteen
years before retiring. She died six years later, leaving the college in a significantly
better financial position and having become the first woman to have either joined
the Aristotelian Society (a prestigious organization dedicated to the study of philosophy) or delivered a paper to Cambridge’s Moral Sciences Club.
 
As mentioned above, Jones made significant contributions to the
philosophy of mind and to the study of formal logic (along with the philosophy of
language). Yet, it is her account of practical reason that most concerns us. In the final passage of Sidgwick’s The Methods of Ethics, he had left open a significant problem
for the field. In this case, one concerning Bentham’s original project of providing a
‘logic of the will’. Sidgwick points out that moral philosophy allows us to explain
why it is rational to act benevolently towards other. However, it is also equally rational to act in our own self-interest. As long as both of these claims are true, we
have no way of arbitrating why we should be benevolent over being self-interested
when the two come into conflict.
 
In order to understand Jones’ answer to Sidgwick’s problem, we should
return to Kant’s answer to the amoralist’s dilemma. On his view, we can tell the self-interested person that they are rationally obligated to be benevolent because of his
categorical imperative. This means that we can derive benevolence from self-interest.
By contrast, Jones argues that it goes the other way around. Instead, we can derive
self-interest from benevolence. Here, she points out that popular moral advice admonishes us to ‘do unto others as they should do unto you’ and to ‘love thy
neighbors as yourself’. This shows that we come to value at all by valuing our own
happiness, which we then extend to others. In this way, benevolence, as a rule,
depends on our being self-interested. As such, the two ideas are not actually in opposition at all.
 
509
Frances Wright & Annie Besant 
 
The trio of Bentham, John Stuart Mill, and Sidgwick is often said to make
up ‘classical utilitarianism’. As you can see, this grouping is rather arbitrary. If it is
supposed to be historical, then Harriet Taylor Mill stands out as an obviously
contemporaneous thinker alongside her husband. If it is supposed to pick out
philosophers who did work that is more purely theoretical, rather than applied, then we can point to the fact that John Stuart Mill wrote on a large number of more
applied questions while E.E. Constance Jones wrote primarily on theoretical issues.
In honesty, the distinction likely has more to do with the fact that Jones and Harriet
Taylor Mill are women, rather than chronology or subject matter. As we saw when it comes to Harriet Taylor Mill’s failure to be credited for the full extent of her work,
women thinkers are often marginalized within the dominant conversation within
philosophy. This, in turn, likely explains (in at least part) why we are able to say that
Bentham, J.S. Mill, and Sidgwick have been the most influential thinkers from the period. However, if we were to not limit ourselves to influence within philosophy,
the impact of women utilitarians during this period is much more significant.
Indeed, utilitarianism (since the time of Bentham) has had ambitions to be a
practical philosophy and a wellspring of social reform. In this regard, Frances 
Wright and Annie Besant stand out at thinkers who do a great deal to push utilitarianism even further into the public sphere.
 
While we have generally proceeded in chronological order throughout this
text, Wright was actually born sometime between Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart
Mill. Her father was a wealthy Scottish industrialist with liberal tendencies. He is known to have supported both the American and French revolutions and to have
maintained correspondence with key liberal enlightenment thinkers like Thomas
Paine and Adam Smith. However, she received little direct influence from this habit
as she was orphaned at a young age. Instead, extended family on her mother’s side took to educating her and her sisters, with special emphasis on the work of French
Enlightenment philosophy (while she maintained her own interest in the works of
Epicurus). This eventually led to Frances returning to Scotland to live with a great-
uncle of hers who taught philosophy. After an extended trip to America in her twenties, during which time she wrote and produced a play in support of the Swiss
 
510 independence movement, Wright traveled back to England and set to work writing a
book about her time in America for a British audience. The success of his work
garnered her an invitation by Bentham to join a small group of intellectuals formed
around their religious skepticism. It also saw her traveling to Paris to meet with the French American Revolutionary War hero Lafayette (who her father had at one
point corresponded with). The two eventually became friends, and Wright would go
on to travel with the aging Marquis during his farewell tour of the United States.
 
It was on this tour that Wright would begin to make a name for herself in
America. She stayed with Thomas Jefferson at Monticello, and met with former President James Madison, current President John Quincy Adams, and future
President Andrew Jackson. However, Wright’s most transformative experience on
the trip came when she visited a number of recently built utopian communities in
Pennsylvania and Indiana. The experience moved her to remain in the country, become a U.S. citizen, and dedicate her life to social reform. Here, her project
focused on emancipation. She consulted with Jefferson and Lafayette about the
establishment of a utopian colony which might demonstrate the economic
advantages of emancipation, and the 320 acres she bought outside of Memphis, Tennessee would eventually become the Nashoba Commune. However, despite its
high ambitions, the project quickly fell into disarray, with others in the abolitionist
movement critical of Wright’s strategy, widespread malaria, and poor soil quality on
the farm. When the colony collapsed five years after its establishment, Wright secured passage to the newly independent Haiti for the thirty now emancipated
former slaved who had inhabited it. With the goal of directly establishing a utopian
commune behind her, Wright dedicated herself more fully to writing and public
lecturing, giving speeches on abolitionism, women’s suffrage, marital reform, sexual
liberation, and the importance of women in healthcare. This work earned her infamy as a controversial public figure until her untimely death at 57 from injuries related to
falling on ice outside her home.
 
As we might expect given the influence that Epicurus had on her, Wright
follows Bentham in arguing that pleasure is the measure of the good. Also like Bentham, she is principally concerned with how we, as a society, can achieve greater
and greater quality of life for everyone, while also asserting the total equality of all
 
511
people.187 This compels Wright to endorse socialism as a political project and
feminism as a social philosophy. The question, however, is how we can actually
achieve this. Like the other utilitarians we have so far discussed, Wright is an
empiricist. On her view, we establish true knowledge on the basis of observation and this knowledge forms the basis for our opinions and beliefs. However, here Wright
uses terms like ‘opinion’ and ‘belief’ more broadly than we might today. For
instance, because history offers interpretations of observable facts rather than merely
accumulating those fact, it is (as a subject matter) a matter of belief. This sets the
stage for Wright’s political and social project. If we are to equalize and maximize the quality of life of everyone within society then, Wright argues, we ought to take an all-
hands-on-deck approach to generating true knowledge and, eventually, good beliefs.
Because education and inquiry provide us with a reliable way of guiding our policy,
it makes sense to spread these practices as widely as possible throughout our society. When women, racial minorities, and the lower class are excluded from science,
education, and healthcare, everyone suffers. However, this exclusion also impacts
marginalized communities to a greater degree. Wright points out that the lack of
education among women renders them dependent on their fathers and husbands, and the power this gives men provides them with a perverse incentive to keep women
in ignorance.
 
While Frances Wright’s willingness to follow utilitarianism wherever it
might lead, even if that led to considerable public controversy, does make her stand out, she was certainly not alone in doing that. Another important utilitarian social
reformer active during the 19th century was Annie Besant. Besant was born in London, to an Irish Catholic mother and English father. Like Wright, Besant’s father
also died when she was quite young (at only five years old). As a result of this, she
was sent to be fostered while her mother focused on running a boarding school in order to pay for Annie’s brother’s schooling. She would remain in foster care until
the age of sixteen, where she stayed until marrying an Anglican cleric four years later.
However, the two often argued; her husband often failed to maintain gainful
employment and insisted on their having more children (an idea she resisted for financial reasons). To compensate for this situation, Besant began writing, which
 
187 Wright also endorses a kind of moral sense theory. This should make sense to us given the influence that the sentimentalists have so far had on the utilitarians.  
 
512 brought the family some small amount of money, and that money would
immediately fall under the purview of her husband. When her daughter became
gravely ill, Besant began to question her faith. She continued to consult with
ministers, theologians, and other thinkers about her doubts until she eventually came to deny her former religion altogether. This caused tensions between the couple as
Besant refused to attend communion and her husband feared what this would mean
for his reputation and his employment in the clergy. Eventually, they split, Besant
left the home with her young daughter, and she took up work doing needlework and
writing for a secular newsletter. She also began a series of public lectures on morality, worker’s rights, and the rights of women.
 
Things in Besant’s life took a dramatic turn when, in 1876, the American
physician and author Charles Knowlton released a book titled Fruits of Philosophy.
The text was initially used by Knowlton to educate his patients on sexual health and methods of birth control. However, when it became more widely available,
Knowlton was tried and sentenced to three months of hard labor and his publishers
in America and in England were both prosecuted as well. Besant, along with the
president of the National Secular Society, jumped into action, immediately beginning to publish the work where the others had left off. Besant’s now estranged
husband filed a motion with the court on the basis of her apparent support for birth
control and used the resulting controversy to secure full custody of their daughter.
Besant and her colleague were also put on trial for their role in the publication of the book and, while she was convicted, this was later overturned due to a technicality in
the law. She then dedicated herself more fully to political activism while, at the same
time, completing a college degree at London University. While she did graduate, the
university was so afraid of being associated with her that her name was not included
on the program at graduation and she was mailed her diploma instead.
 
Besant’s political activities in the time period focused on work with the
newly formed socialist Fabian Society, running a secular and socialist newsletter
called Our Corner, and being involved in a series of worker’s riots and strikes. This
remained her focus fully until the beginning of the twentieth century. At this point, especially spurred on by the vulnerable position that the first world war left Britain
in, Besant began organizing for the rights of Indians, who were under British
occupation. She became an outspoken critic of British imperialism, child marriage,
 
513 and the caste system, drawing on renewed calls for Irish independence as a model for
India. Here, she helped to establish the Central Hindu College, along with the All
India Home Rule League, which helped to mobilize meetings and protests. This
work ultimately led to her arrest in England. Besant’s imprisonment became a focal point for the Indian independence movement. Eventually, after significant protests
in her support by the Muslim League, the government relented, releasing her. One of
the many people writing in support of her release was the 43rd President of the Indian
National Congress and Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, who praised
the influence of her work on his own. Besant would remain a strong and outspoken advocate for Indian home rule until her death in India at the age of 85.
 
In terms of Besant’s philosophical views, they (by her own account)
changed considerably throughout her life. At various points, her work incorporates
elements of not only utilitarianism, but classical orthodox Indian philosophy, as well as virtue ethics. However, it is better to think of her views as becoming more
nuanced and elaborate over time, rather than constantly flipping back and forth.
Even her defense of virtue as the highest good still justified its value in the fact that,
on her view, self-sacrifice produces the highest form of happiness. Yet, she also diagnoses what she sees as a fatal mistake with the view. Namely, that maximizing
happiness overall often produces an underclass of unsatisfied people. There is no
distinct guarantee that what is best overall is best for everyone. This realization was,
in part, due to her exposure to works from the yoga and Vedanta schools of classical Indian philosophy. The oneness of all people emphasized by, for instance, Advaita
Vedanta, drew her to the conclusion that we needed a theory which captured what
was valuable about classical utilitarianism while, at the same time, respecting the
individual value of every person. The absolute unity of all people forms the basis of
her view, which sees the project of human morality as an attempt to bring about harmony and, as a consequence, flourishing for this unified body. This goal, in turn,
is best achieved when we act in the direction of benevolence towards others or, as
Besant will conclude, virtuously. Incorporating even more influences, Besant argues
that we can think of becoming virtuous as an expansion of our moral sentiments towards the eventual goal of regarding existence as a single unified whole and acting
in the direction of bringing about and maximizing its flourishing. This should strike
us as very similar to the developmental story we have seen among the sentimentalists
 
514
(another major influence on utilitarians broadly), but her presentation of the view
also draws heavily on the newly introduced biological theory of evolution.188 We will
come to see that evolution and natural selection will play a major role in the work of
those who come after the utilitarians, the pragmatists.

19th Century 
 
Continental 
 
Philosophy 
 
We have seen, going back to the divide between the rationalists and the
empiricists, a general but imperfect split between philosophy happening in Britain
and its colonies and philosophy as it is on the European mainland. While this philosophical tradition, tracing itself back to the greater Mediterranean region,
remained a more or less unified conversation in the 19th century, the distinction
between philosophy on both sides of the English Channel will start to become more
entrenched during this time. While there is, or will be, an ideological basis for this split, it has as much or more to do with language as it does deeper intellectual
commitments. Philosophy across Europe was united in the medieval period by the
common use of Latin as the written lingua franca. Scottish, German, and French
philosophers lived far away from one another and spoke different languages in their
daily life, but the Roman Catholic Church acted as a kind of unifying force, which made sure that all parties could read and would write in Latin. With the
development of the printing press during the time of the Italian Renaissance and
Protestant Reformation, it became much easier and more affordable for thinkers and
readers to produce and consume written works in their own language. Given this, and without a single universal church mandating a common written language,
philosophers across Europe slowly began to establish a norm of working in their
 
517 native language. Descartes’ Meditations on First Philosophy, Hobbes’ De Cive, and
much of Leibniz’ work was originally written in Latin, but the standard was rapidly
changing throughout the early modern period. By the 19th century, few if any
secular philosophers wrote in Latin. This meant that different countries began to become more siloed, with philosophers in those countries focusing more and more
on reading and responding to works in their native language and doing so by writing
in their native language.
 
While the anglophone world saw the empiricists give way to the
sentimentalists and then the utilitarians, mainland Europe witnessed the rationalist tradition lead to the idealists. However, it is much harder to say what follows from
the idealists. To be clear, idealism remained a powerful force within philosophy (just
as empiricism did), but the emerging philosophy of the era turned towards
something much more skeptical. The idealists, in many ways, are grappling with the legacy of Kant. His declaration that we can have knowledge of the phenomenal
world but not the things-in-themselves immediately raised the question of why we
should think the things-in-themselves exist at all. We can see the agenda of 19th
century European philosophy being set in large part by Hegel. Hegel had taken the emerging interest in history which characterized the idealists and used it to exclaim
the virtues of the Enlightenment. While the other idealists were inspired by, and
inspiring to, the romantic movement (a seeming rejection of Greek-inspired
rationalism), Hegel would be the Enlightenment's biggest and last great defender. However, as we will see, it is not at all obvious that careful study of history would
reveal the merits of rationalism, yet not for the reasons that the romantics might
think. Mainland European philosophy (or as it will come to be called, ‘continental 
philosophy’) will remain fixated on the historical method in the 19th century, but it
will also gain a much more skeptical edge. In fact, it may be that the only thing
unifying many of the thinkers in this period is their common hermeneutics of suspicion. The term ‘hermeneutics’ here refers to the study of interpretation, and
late 19th and early 20th century continental philosophy is characterized, in many
 
518 ways, by a common attempt to interpret the world, philosophy, society, morality,
and the self from a standpoint of suspicion towards their outward appearances.189 
 
The suspicious stance that thinkers of the era begin to take is not limited to
philosophy as well. Charles Darwin can be read as attempting to probe at the hidden
meaning of the natural world. It is not, after all, just a simple fact that different finches have different kinds of beaks. Instead, we can discern the hidden meaning of
this fact: these beaks serve different functions. As it turns out, this has profound
implications for how humans came to inhabit our planet. In the same way, we can
look to the work of Sigmund Freud (while he is writing slightly later) as a model of suspicious interpretation. Perhaps our actions and desires are simply as they are at
face value, but perhaps there is a hidden deeper meaning to them. It may be that our
dreams are just scattered bits of information thrown into our sleeping consciousness
in haphazard, and sometimes bizarre, ways. However, what if they could be interpreted? What if they too could have a hidden meaning? As it turns out, while
Freud is remembered predominantly in the popular imagination as a psychologist,
his philosophical legacy has, in some ways, outlasted his scientific work.190 
 
189 The idea that these thinkers share this hermeneutics of suspicion in common comes from the 20th century French philosopher Paul Ricœur. 190 Freud will be incredibly influential among other 20th century philosophers working in the psychoanalytic tradition, especially in France and Germany. Those indebted to or inspired by Freud include the French thinker Jacques Lacan (who developed a widely influential theory of drives), along with the thinkers of the Frankfurt school (who attempted to synthesize the work of Freud and Marx in order to better understand political authoritarianism). This project came to be known as ‘critical theory’. Important Frankfurt school philosophers include Max Horkheimer (who argued that efficiency-obsessed means-end thinking, also called ‘instrumental reason’, leads to the development of authoritarianism), Theodor Adorno (who famously argued, among other things, against the value of jazz music from a critical socialist perspective), and Herbert Marcuse (who, among other things, analyzed the ways in which revolutionary ways of thinking are co-opted and used keep people oppressed). Another key figure of the Frankfurt school is Hannah Arendt, who will be discussed in the “The Phenomenology” chapter. Freud’s influence was also not without its critics. Famously, one of the most influential books written by the 20th century French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari was primarily written as a criticism of Freud’s influence on philosophy.
 
519
To be clear, not all of the philosophers we will cover in this chapter are
historical thinkers, but many are. In the same way, not all of them are widely
considered to embody the hermeneutics of suspicion, but most will at least be directly
critical of Hegel. Both of these trends point towards a common interest in grappling with the consequences of modernity. The early modern period of Descartes, Hobbes,
Locke, and Leibniz laid the groundwork for modern life through rationalism and the
scientific revolution,  while Hegel and the Utilitarians attempted to complete the
project within domains outside of the sciences. Rapid industrialization saw the
emergence of assembly lines, the spread of factories, and the inflation of cities. If the Enlightenment is founded on the believe that we can improve our lot in life through
science, technology, and liberal capitalism, continental philosophy in the 19th century
can be seen as an attempt to scrutinize this belief and evaluate the ways in which the
Enlightenment project has, despite its many major successes, failed to fully deliver on its promises, failed to construct a fully objective and rational understanding of reality,
and failed to fully provide us with a basis for a meaningful life without the assumption
of a religion to grant us that. What we are left to do, given this, will persist as the
question of the age.
 
Arthur Schopenhauer 
 
The first significant philosopher after Hegel, and an ardent critic of his
(along with the other German idealists), is Arthur Schopenhauer. Schopenhauer was born into a Dutch family in Danzig in present day Poland. Both of his parents
were well-educated and politically engaged; they supported the French revolution
and held republican beliefs about government (meaning they did not endorse monarchy, but representative democracy). While both parents came from wealthy
backgrounds, his father’s career as a merchant did more than enough to secure the
family’s livelihood. His father so strongly envisioned him following in his own
footsteps in this regard that he specifically chose the name Arthur because of the fact that it is spelled in the same way across a number of languages, which he thought
would make a career in international trade easier. The young Schopenhauer was
initially committed to this life plan, traveling around Europe with his parents,
 
520 learning French and English, and securing an apprenticeship in business. However, it
did not take long after his father’s death before Schopenhauer decided to follow his
own passions, for learning.191 Interestingly, Schopenhauer’s newly widowed mother
would move, along with his sisters, to Weimar (in Germany), where she would befriend Goethe and establish herself as a writer of essays, novels, and biographies.
While he and his mother did not get along throughout their lives, her opening of a
Salon in Weimar did allow him to come to know Goethe (who would become a
mentor to him) and introduced him to works of Classical Indian philosophy.
 
In terms of his more formal education, Schopenhauer spent time at the University of Gӧttingen and the University of Berlin (where he took courses with
Fichte and Schleiermacher) before completing his dissertation remotely through the
University of Jena. Immediately after completing his degree, Schopenhauer moved
to Dresden and began converting the views he presented in his dissertation into what would become his most influential book, The World as Will and Representation.
With the text completed four years later, Schopenhauer applied to a teaching
position at his alma mater, the University of Berlin. Rather ambitiously, he
specifically requested that he teach courses at the same time as, then famous and aging, Hegel, putting the two in direct competition for students. However, this
backfired when Schopenhauer’s lectures failed to attract many students and Hegel’s
remained full. This experience, along with others, soured his view of academic
philosophy, which he thought had become too abstract and impractical. He became more and more bitter and began to further isolate himself. This downward spiral
reached its lowest point when Schopenhauer got into a fight in the boarding house
in which he lived. The confrontation, which began when Schopenhauer complained
that a seamstress and fellow resident of the house was talking too loudly and thereby
preventing him from working, ended in a shoving match, followed by a lawsuit which Schopenhauer lost. Schopenhauer continued toiling away at his philosophical
writing to little or no fanfare for year after year. He remained quite isolated for the
 
191 While the exact cause of Schopenhauer’s father’s death is unknown, it is widely believed that it was the result of suicide; an experience which presumably would have had a profound impact on the young Schopenhauer. The question of whether or not this is related to the philosophical pessimism he eventually became so well known for is left as an exercise for the reader.
 
521 rest of his life, preferring the company of poodles to humans, and spending his time
studying classical Indian and Chinese philosophy. However, he did eventually attain
widespread fame among the public, yet it came quite late in life, and only after an
English review of his work was translated back into German. However inexplicable this success was, Schopenhauer attempted to make the most of it, traveling widely
and lecturing for the final years of his life.
 
As we have already said, perhaps the only thing uniting the major figures in
this period is their mutual distaste for the views of Hegel. Schopenhauer is no
exception here. In addition to writing scathing personal criticisms of almost all of the German idealists, Schopenhauer also objected to their absolute idealism on
philosophical grounds. Like Hegel, Schelling, and Fichte before him, Schopenhauer
is convinced by much of what Kant tells us. Kant tells us that there is a noumenal
realm composed of things-in-themselves, along with the phenomenal realm, composed of our mental representations of these things. However, because we are
always bound by the limits of the categories imposed on the mind (such as space and
time), we cannot, in Kant’s view, know about the natures of the things-in-
themselves. This basic picture, that of transcendental idealism, sets the backdrop for the idealists who come after Kant. As we know, the question on everyone’s minds is,
if we can’t know about the things of the noumenal world, why posit them at all? If
they are unknowable in principle, they don’t seem to be able to explain anything
within our theory, and if we can’t know of them, then how do we know that they exist? This is the gauntlet thrown down by the absolute idealists like Hegel.
Schopenhauer believes that he has an answer to this problem and, as a result, a reason
to prefer something closer to Kant’s transcendental idealism over Hegel’s absolute
idealism.
 
For Schopenhauer, the issue of the existence of the external world, or the things-in-themselves, arises because of Kant’s belief, taken on board by the idealists,
that we do not have a way to come to knowledge of the noumenal realm that isn’t
first mediated by the limits of our senses. However, Schopenhauer claims that there
is at least one thing that we do, in fact, have direct knowledge of: ourselves. We can, on the one hand, understand the body through the senses in the way that Kant
would have us, but we can also come to know it through introspection. We can feel
the hunger which moves us to seek out cookies, and we can see and taste the cookies
 
522 we eat, but we also have direct access to our desire for them, our beliefs about them,
and our intention to seek them out. Our senses represent our bodily desires in this
way. Since we can apparently know at least one thing-in-itself directly, we do have
reason to posit the existence of mind-independent things.
 
What, then, does exist, according to Schopenhauer’s view? The will. We know our own will through introspection, just as we know the phenomenal us through
perception. Our nature is, then, inherently dual. These two self-images, the will and
the representation, are just aspects of a single unified whole. Schopenhauer then
argues that this is the nature of all of the things-in-themselves; every object is characterizable in terms of its will and its representation, and by introspecting on our
own will, we can come to further knowledge of the will more generally, and
therefore the outside world. On the basis of this introspection, Schopenhauer
concludes that the world of the will composes a single unified whole. We can contrast this with the varied appearance of the world as it is represented to us; it
certainly doesn’t seem to be unified. This should strike us as very similar to the
position taken in classical Indian philosophy on the problem of the one and the
many. This should not surprise us, as we know Schopenhauer was a student of Indian philosophy.
 
Beyond just arguing with Hegel over the reality of the things-in-themselves,
the difference between the two thinkers leads Schopenhauer to argue for a much
stronger conclusion. This argument depends crucially on Schopenhauer’s views
about the principle of sufficient reason. You may recall that this is the principle articulated and endorsed by Leibniz, that everything must have a reason, cause, or
ground. Notice, however, that a reason and a cause are two different things, which
Schopenhauer argues are confined to two different realms. To say that everything
must have a reason is to make an epistemological claim about our concepts and beliefs. To say that everything must have a cause is to make a claim about the
physical world of things. For Schopenhauer, we have tended to equivocate these
things because the principle of sufficient reason is the most fundamental of our
mental categories. Underlying our inherent concepts of space and time (Kant’s categories), is the principle of sufficient reason. Our acceptance of the principle is
what really structures our mental life, and it is what characterizes us as humans. The
issue is that the principle of sufficient reason as it concerns reasons rules in the realm
 
523 of the will, and the principle as it concerns causes is a matter of the world of
representation. We have no reason to think that the physical, causal, perceptible
world is governed by the kind of reason we see in rationalizing. This is a key
difference between Schopenhauer and Hegel. We saw that Hegel thought that everything happening across history happens for a reason (the self-realization of
geist). In Schopenhauer’s view, Hegel is, here, equivocating between the causal realm
and the logical realm. We have no basis for thinking that the world operates
according to any kind of teleological mechanism. There is no causal evidence that
everything in nature happens according to a bigger plan or has any larger purpose. This distinguishes Hegel’s supremely optimistic view that events are always working
towards the larger project of truth and freedom from Schopenhauer’s pessimism. We
look for reasons in the world of causes because the principle of sufficient reason
structures our minds; it compels us to do so. Yet, there is no rational basis for this. If anything, it seems clearly wrong. The true nature of the world is unified, yet all of
the causal stories we tell ourselves about the world are about individuated objects
acting on one another. Interactions between these individuated objects are exactly
the kind of thing Hegel would seek to find reason in. Yet, we know that the entire picture is wrong because it denies the total unity of reality. We are condemned,
according to Schopenhauer’s view, to look for purpose in a world devoid of it. The
only bit of optimism to be found in his account is within his aesthetic theory.
While perception of the actual world is fixated on the individuated
appearances presented to us in representation, we can still represent things as more
unified than the limits of the natural world will allow. This is precisely what happens in the aesthetic realm. When we encounter, for instance, one of Schopenhauer’s
beloved poodles, we can represent it as it appears to us (an individual poodle).
However, we can also engage with it aesthetically; we can perceive it as the universal
form to which it belongs. We might see the poodle and say, “Margot is out in the yard right now,” (a description of the world as representation), but we might also be
prompted to say that “poodles are beautiful animals.” This mode of engagement,
aesthetic perception, holds the objects of the mind as universal and, in doing so,
focuses on them as they are outside of the perceptual limits of time and space. This
is, in fact, what artists do when they produce works. Few of us can move through life entirely engaged in aesthetic perception. Instead, we rely on artists to bring us into it.
The ability of an artist to do that is just what artistic genius is on Schopenhauer’s
 
524 view. Further, he argues that the causal world as represented to us is strictly
governed. There is, in his estimation, no room for our will to actually cause anything
in it (as the will and the representation are two sides of the same underlying truth
and therefore cannot act on each other).192 The only space in which this determinism opens up to allow more human freedom is in our capacity for aesthetic perception.
Here, as evidenced by the fact that we can cognize independently of the causal
constraints on the world (which focuses on individuals), we are truly free.
 
Karl Marx 
 
If there is one philosopher in the past two hundred years that can be said to
have the most profound and widespread effect on the course of human history, it is
easily Karl Marx. While Enlightenment thinkers like Locke may have had a major impact on the American Revolution (along with the French and Haitian), the
political and social philosophy derived from Marx’s work has arguably had an
equally significant effect on a greater number of people, through the Russian and Chinese Revolutions. However, it is important to separate Marx as a thinker and
author from the many varied interpretations of his work and their lasting
consequences.
 
Marx was born in Trier in the Kingdom of Prussia (in modern-day
Germany near the Luxembourg border). His family was ethnically Jewish but had converted to Christianity before the time of his birth in order to avoid
discrimination in employment. His father worked as a lawyer but diversified his
income by investing in local vineyards as well. This gave the Marx family a
comfortable but not lavish lifestyle. Being a man of letters (as a lawyer), Marx’s father was deeply invested in the Enlightenment ideas and revolutions of the time and
raised his nine children in a mostly secular but nominally Lutheran manner. His
father also personally saw to the young Marx’s education as well, teaching him until
 
192 Notice the similarities between this account and Leibniz’ theory of pre-established harmony.
 
525 he secured his enrollment at a liberally oriented school (one that would eventually be
raided by the police for endorsing Enlightenment liberalism).
 
By the time that Marx was sixteen, he had enrolled at the University of
Bonn, ostensibly on the basis of following in his father’s footsteps and becoming a
lawyer. However, the young Marx was quickly transformed by his time in college, joining a radical student organization that was, at the time, being monitored by the
police. During this period, Marx also struggled in school due to personal issues. For
one thing, he had a clear interest in studying philosophy rather than the law.
However, in addition to this, he garnered a reputation for quarrelling with other students over personal matters, with one such altercation rising to the level of a duel.
Frustrated by this, his father transferred him to the, then, much more rigorous
University of Berlin.
 
In Berlin, his father’s efforts seem to work. Marx began to take his
schoolwork more seriously and became engaged to the minor noble Jenny von
Westphalen. While the pair was unconventional and not without controversy (given
their religious and economic differences), Marx did eventually win the support of
von Westphalen’s father, whose liberal political sympathies would eventually result in Marx dedicating his doctoral dissertation to him. Despite doing well in his law
courses, Marx still couldn’t shake his interest in philosophy and Berlin was a great
place to cultivate this interest. While Hegel had recently passed away at the time of
Marx’s arrival, the department was still very much under his influence. This drew
Marx to join social clubs focused on Hegel’s ideas, and from these Marx found his
way into the Young Hegelians. This school of philosophers was founded by
Ludwig Feuerbach and focused on politically radical interpretations of Hegel.193 
Marx continued to be involved with the Young Hegelians, editing works of Hegel’s,
while finishing his doctoral dissertation, which was, on the surface, focused on ancient Greek atomism and Epicureanism, while actually advocating for philosophy
 
193 Today Feuerbach is most well-known for his using the philosophy of Hegel to argue that our idea of God is made in our own image and not the other way around. The use of Hegel’s views to criticize and interrogate Christianity was common to the young Hegelians, with another central member (and mentor to Marx), Bruno Bauer, famously arguing against the historicity of Jesus and for the view that Christianity was a philosophical synthesis of Judaism and the stoicism that was popular at the time Jesus is said to have lived. 
 
526 as superior to religion. The work was apparently so controversial that Marx felt the
need to send it to the University of Jena rather than his own University of Berlin, as
it had a reputation for being more liberal.
 
It was not long after completing his degree that Marx’s political activity and
associations began to make it dangerous for him to continue living in Prussian Germany, at which point he left for Paris. Paris, at the time, was much more radical
in temperament. It was there that he met the Russian anarchist (and fellow
Hegelian) Mikhail Bakunin, along with the French anarchist Pierre-Joseph 
Proudhon (famous for arguing that property is a form of theft).194 During this time Marx continued to write, and these writings show the development of the views that he would eventually become famous for. This general trend, away from the
liberalism that Marx was raised and educated in and towards more and more radical
and communitarian politics, is also reflected in the social circles that he kept while in Paris. The most crucial point in this process came when Marx met a fellow German
radical philosopher, Friedrich Engels. The two were both members of a larger
group of German radicals who were hiding out from Prussian authorities in Paris
and who, in the meantime, operated a radical German-language newspaper entitled Vorwärts! The two immediately hit it off and began a lifelong collaboration.
However, within two years of his arrival in Paris, the Prussian government had
successfully lobbied the French government to crack down on Vorwärts!, and the
radicals who supported and wrote for it were forced to scatter. Marx continued to bounce around Europe for one or two years at a time, writing and engaging in
political activism until he would be forced to leave and begin the process again.
 
194 Anarchism was gaining in popularity in this period, with other active anarchist thinkers including the Russian philosopher Peter Kropotkin (who argued for a decentralized form of communism called ‘anarcho-communism’), the Lithuanian-born Emma Goldman (famous for arguing for permissibility of targeted political violence in order to stir up revolutionary sentiment, called ‘propaganda of the deed’), and the Italian Errico Malatesta (who argued for the revolutionary strategy of attempting to elect socialists to positions of political power while also using workers unions as a way to gain control of the economy). This latter belief, that unions can be leveraged to secure worker control over the economy is sometimes referred to as ‘syndicalism’. 
 
527
The final stop on Marx’s unintentional revolutionary tour of Europe turned
out to be London. There, Marx dedicated himself fully to studying, with this taking
an obvious economic toll on his family. While he was eventually able to secure a job
as a foreign correspondent in London for the New-York Daily Tribune, this income was consistently supplemented by payments from Engels, whose wealthy father was
a factory owner in England. Indeed, it is now believed that the vast majority of the
articles that Marx was paid for by the New-York Daily Tribune were also written by
Engels. In any case, Marx continued to be employed by the paper until a change in
ownership meant that the editorial board switched from endorsing the Union in the American Civil War (and the project of abolitionism), to calling for a ceasefire that
would leave slavery intact in the American South. This change was a dealbreaker for
Marx (who would later go on to personally write a letter congratulating U.S.
President Abraham Lincoln on his reelection and declaring the necessity of the cause
of abolitionism), and he was once again unemployed.195 Despite not bringing in any
money, Marx remained hard at work, reading extensively at the British Museum and
writing a number of his largest and most influential works. In 1883, after a lifetime
of health problems exacerbated by heavy drinking, poor diet, and maintaining long hours of work, Marx died. At the time of his death, Marx was stateless, with no
country claiming him as a citizen, and he was buried in a special area of London’s
Highgate Cemetery, reserved for atheists and agnostics. Fewer than two dozen
people attended his funeral (and perhaps as few as nine), and his death went unnoted in newspapers for several days. Yet, despite seeming to have lived a lifetime of
obscurity only to slip even further out of the limelight by the time of his death,
within seventy years, about one third of all humans on the planet would be living
under regimes claiming to embody his views. By 2005, a poll conducted by the BBC found that Marx was considered, by the public, to be the greatest philosopher of all
 
195 Lincoln would also write a response to Marx’s letter. However, Lincoln addresses his comments to the larger organization that Marx is writing on behalf of, rather than to Marx personally. 
 
528 time’, and by 2013, a team of researchers concluded a study which found him to be
the most influential thinker of all time in terms of academic citations.196 
 
Despite his seemingly singular influence, both within philosophy and
without, Marx is, in many ways, a synthetic thinker. We have already said that he was
deeply influenced by Hegel’s philosophy, along with fellow Young Hegelians like Bauer and Feuerbach, but he also draws heavily from Scottish Enlightenment
thinkers as well. In his own estimation, Marx saw himself as correcting one
fundamental error in Hegel’s thinking and following the resulting picture where it
leads. The issue, in this case, is one regarding Hegel’s theory of history. Recall that Hegel saw history as a purpose-driven force which aims at absolute freedom and
truth. In turn, the story of our working from a state of nature to this end point can
be characterized in terms of a series of conflicts centered on worldviews. These
ideological conflicts present us with a thesis, an antithesis emerges from it, and eventually the two views are synthesized into the next stage of development. Notice
that, according to this view, the engine of history is ideas. Our ideas about the world
are refined over time and the process which refines them increases our control over
the natural world (through science and technology), bolsters our moral development, and improves the conditions of our lives. This is precisely the aspect
that Marx zeroes in on in his critique of Hegel. When Marx looks at the history of
conflicts that Hegel describes, he concludes that Hegel’s account amounts to little
more than saying that the tail wags the dog. However, in order to see how and why, we should start at the beginning.
 
While it is certainly not the most famous aspect of his view, Marx’s account
begins with a theory of human nature. Looking at history, we can see that humans
have an insatiable drive to control their environment. We are, in many ways, defined
by the extent of our tool use. We develop tools to fill any niche and work tirelessly to extract resources ever more efficiently from nature. The transforming of the natural

529 world into usable goods drives a great deal of human activity, and it also gives us a
certain sense of meaning, purpose, and value. If we were to crash land on a desert
island, not only would our immediate interest be in cultivating our environment to
secure our continued existence, but we would also continue (as best as we could) developing our surroundings until we came to flourish in them. All along, each
major breakthrough would renew us with purpose and give us happiness. We are, in
many respects, natural laborers; we have a drive (in the philosophical sense) to secure
and advance our position within the natural world through our efforts. If this entire
scenario reminds us of anything, it might be the theories of John Locke.
 
Recall that Locke had provided us with an account of property in which we
come to own things by taking them out of the natural commons and ‘mixing our
labor’ with them. Further along the British empiricist tradition, by the time of the
Scottish Enlightenment, this idea began to be explored more. The economist David 
Ricardo, who was a contemporary of Adam Smith and Mary Shepherd took Locke’s claim out of the realm of pure philosophy and into political economy.
Where Locke was providing us with a theory of property, Ricardo uses Locke’s
picture to tell us something about economic value. If we were on a desert island, any one of us would be free to pick the naturally occurring coconuts at no cost. Since no
one person has a claim over them, no one is justified in charging anyone else for
them. However, one of the inhabitants of the island might be especially good at
climbing coconut trees and see this skill as an opportunity. They decide to grab a few extra coconuts while they were up there and offer to give one to someone for a small
fee, saving them the trouble of climbing the tree themselves. So, this probably
doesn’t seem too unreasonable. After all, they are entitled to that coconut (at least on
Locke’s view) in virtue of mixing their labor with it. Likewise, it only seems fair to
compensate them for the work that they put in (and are therefore saving you). Yet, in this short and simple story we have already seen that the value of the coconut went
from zero (on the tree) to the cost of a small fee (after being picked). What accounts
for this increase in value? Clearly it is the labor of the person who climbed it. They
have invested a bit of themselves into the coconut and that demands our respect. Thus, labor is not only the source of our property claims, but also the basis for
economic value. This is, in an extremely simplified rendering, Ricardo’s labor 
theory of value.
 
530
Marx takes Ricardo’s labor theory and his own account of human nature
and uses these pieces to recast the developments that Hegel describes. Looking back,
for the majority of human history, most people were doing the same thing as one
another, just as our desert island began with everyone picking coconuts. However, there was still certainly a dominant class which extracted resources. Initially, this was
probably a strongman who managed to force everyone else to work as slaves for
them. From the time of the Pharaohs in Egypt to the Roman Emperors, slavery
remained the dominant mode of production by which humans organized their labor
in order to develop their environment. While slavery certainly continued past this point (and remains to this day), it did eventually fall away as the dominant form of
social organization. In its place, we saw the rise of feudalism. Here, peasants were
given some limited rights and freedoms, but their lives still looked very much the
same as one another. Most people spent their time farming and working for the dominant class (in this case, the royalty). In Marx’s account of history, this process
(of expanding rights in exchange for new and more efficient modes of production)
continues on through history as a natural consequence of our drive to master our
environment through our labor. Eventually, shortly before Marx’s own time, the dominant mode of production became the capitalist system. In this case, work has
become very diversified. Just as we saw that one person selling their coconuts opened
up the labor of the person that they are selling them to (who is now free to do
something else instead of picking their own), our modern economy relies heavily on the advantages of a division of labor. However, the feature which is most
characteristic of capitalism is that workers sell their labor to capitalists. The capitalist
(that is, the person who owns the means of production) starts a company with the
hope that they will turn a profit. They own the machinery in a centralized factory, and they invite workers in to labor for pay, while they sell the goods produced by
that labor for a profit. Yet, the capitalist’s profit must come from somewhere.
 
If we want to understand the value of the goods they are selling, then we
should first look at the cost required to produce it. It seems intuitive enough that the
value is a representation of everything that went into making that thing, after all, Marx believes that Ricardo has shown the truth of the labor theory of value.
Unfortunately, selling the item at cost would not result in a profit, so the capitalist
must extract some value from somewhere in order for them to make a profit. Because
 
531 the costs of materials just are what they are, Marx argues that profits must come out
of the labor costs. The way to extract profits is simply to pay the laborer less than the
actual value of their work. Of course, we might wonder why the worker should
tolerate this at all. Can’t they just leave and find someone who will pay them fairly? The issue is that this extractive model is not an isolated business practice, it is the
dominant mode of production. To own a business that employs workers in a
capitalist society is, for Marx, to engage in this practice. This means that workers
only really have the choice between being underpaid or starving. When capitalists
take advantage of the bind that workers find themselves in, and use it to extract
value, the workers are victims to a form of exploitation. By contrast, when workers are forced to subject themselves to this process, they experience alienation.
 
Alienation occurs in four ways for Marx. First, we are alienated from the
products of our labor. When we spend our lives working on a factory floor, building cars, we don’t own the cars we have built at the end of the day. Contrast this with the
coconut tree climber, who is entitled to sell their extra coconut because they own it
in virtue of mixing their labor with it. The capitalist takes ownership of the products
of our labor, and this represents, for Marx, a form of alienation. In addition to this, we are also alienated from the act of working. Recall that Marx thinks we, as
humans, inherently derive value from the fruits of our labor. When we make
something, it gives us a sense of purpose and accomplishment. However, in the
diversified economy of capitalism, we may only repeat a small role in the process of bringing goods about. Whereas an artisan in the past might make goods from start to
finish, working with raw materials all the way up to the point of sale, a worker on a
factory line might only manufacture a particular nut or bolt over and over again,
never actually getting the sense of accomplishment which they would otherwise be
entitled to when an entire car is finished being built. We can see this in the fact that many, if not most people, must seek meaning outside of work, despite the fact that
work itself naturally gives us meaning. Third is alienation from ourselves. Beyond the
fact that we don’t get to own or even experience the fruits of our labor under
capitalism, our work is often not even an expression of what projects we actually think are worthwhile. We may be lucky and eventually find ourselves doing
something that we otherwise enjoy, but most of us will at least spend some time
working jobs we can’t stand only in order to pay the bills. Because we take jobs out
 
532 of necessity, we are, in effect, coerced into doing that work. This deprives us of the
joys of working hard at something of our choosing and seeing the effects of that.
Following Kant, this is a kind of negation of the self. As humans, we are autonomous
and rational beings who freely choose how to labor. Indeed, this was crucial to Locke’s belief that we have a right to property in virtue of our labor, as it is an
extension of the self, and we are the masters of ourselves. Marx argues that because
capitalism does not allow for us to fully consent to how we use ourselves, we are
alienated from our own nature as humans. Finally, we are also alienated from each
other. Just as we don’t want to be objectified and treated as a means to secure profit without our full and enthusiastic consent, we really don’t want to treat others that
way either. Yet, the capitalist must come to regard their workers that way, and the
same is true for relations between workers. The middle manager, who is also a worker
on Marx’s view, must enforce this arrangement on workers beneath them. They crack down when workers are not acting efficiently, and they fire them despite
knowing that those workers have families that they need to provide for. The process
requires that everyone regard one another in increasingly inhuman ways, and that is a
kind of moral injury on everyone involved. This is to say that, despite the fact that the manager doesn’t want to be cruel and indifferent to their subordinates, they
must, and the guilt associated with this is put onto them if a capitalist is willing to
pay them to do this work for them.
 
Yet, what have we learned from this story? History, in Marx's view, isn’t a clash of ideas, but a class conflict. Workers today certainly have more rights than
subjects of colonial mercantilism did in the 18th century, just as they were better off
than medieval peasants and ancient slaves before them. However, this development
was not the result of our thinking better about how workers ought to be treated, but
the consequence of workers within each period rising up and demanding a new
arrangement. We can call this position on the nature of history ‘dialectical materialism’. It is dialectical in the same way that Hegel’s view is, it is characterized
by a series of conflicts. However, whereas Hegel saw history being driven by ideas,
Marx sees it as a matter of material conditions such as wealth, labor, and resources; this is the sense in which Marx is a materialist.
 
However, while Marx certainly thinks that capitalism is the best mode of
production so far, and the most advanced and free, it is not the final stage in our
 
533 development. We can see this, Marx thinks, in recognizing the inherent
contradictions within the system. Chief among these is the fact that capitalists make
money by selling their goods at a profit. Yet, profits rely on underpaying workers for
their labor. The problem is that if workers are continuously underpaid, then they can’t afford to buy the goods that capitalists are selling. So, on the one hand,
capitalism pushes capitalists to pay workers less and less while, at the same time, still
relying on the income of their workers in the form of sales. This, in Marx’s view, is
unsustainable. Eventually, workers will be squeezed to the point that they will rise up
and bring a new mode of production into being. While Marx uses different language
to describe this next phase, most readers now think of it as a form of socialism.
 
In Marx’s theory, this socialist mode is characterized by a ‘dictatorship of
the proletariat’.197 Marx refers to the working class as the proletariat, and they can
be contrasted with the capitalist/ownership class, or bourgeoisie.198 While it may sound harsh to say that Marx advocates for a ‘dictatorship’, it is important to keep two things in mind. First, this is not, in his mind, a government characterized by a
central authoritarian ruler. Since the proletariat are a class, this form of government
means rule by the workers (of which there are very many), not a single strongman. Second, and perhaps more importantly, is the fact that Marx thinks that capitalism
represents a dictatorship by the bourgeoisie. This is to say that Marx is not
advocating for our society to become more dictatorial than it already is. As it stands
now, the capitalist decides everything about the conditions of the workplace, form when people will work and how much they will be paid to advertising strategies and
large company-wide goals. Meanwhile, workers in Marx’s socialist society will still
 
197 Importantly, Marx did not develop the concept of socialism, nor is his account of it necessarily representative. For one thing, there are many socialists who don’t see socialism as an interim phase used to bring about communism. This feature is, in some ways, yet another example of Marx’s tendency to synthesize different existing works, as it represents the bringing together of Hegel’s theory of history with the already established French socialist tradition.  
198 The German philosopher and labor leader Clara Zetkin will eventually argue that it is this bourgeoisie, capitalist class, that is responsible for women’s oppression, rather than proletarian men. She also argued that the class divide between women of the proletariat and bourgeoise resulted in them having different interests, with proletarian women not always being represented among the more bourgeois leaders of the feminist movement. 
 
534 hold different kinds of jobs like they do under capitalism and there will still be some
differences in wealth and income. The central difference is that rather than capitalists
owning the means of production, the workers would.
 
However, this is still only a transitional phase before the bringing about of
the final stage of history: communism. By this time, Marx’s theory predicts that we will so efficiently extract resources and develop goods that we will functionally live
beyond the limits of scarcity. Because there is so much abundance, there will be no
class differences in communism, and because these class differences are the source of
historical conflict, without them, we will not have need for a government to arbitrate conflicts. We would be, in effect, free of the circumstances of justice which
philosophers as far back as Hume and Han Fei described. This classless, stateless
society represents, for Marx, the end of history. Given the abundance and freedom
that communism entails, workers will not be coerced to fill certain roles, working jobs they don’t like in order to provide for themselves and their family. This means a
total lack of alienation. Here, workers will follow their passions and develop
themselves and their labor productively and as they wish.
 
Yet, we have still not fully inverted Hegel as Marx promised. Dialectical materialism does argue that history is driven by material conditions and not ideas, as
Hegel thought, but Hegel’s claim was more than this. He thought that ideas (in the
form of our zeitgeist) enable us to change our material conditions. For instance, we
abolished slavery on the basis of our recognition that it violated the rights of the
enslaved. Without an intellectual framework for thinking about rights, we couldn’t uncover this deeper, more fundamental form of freedom. If Marx is, then, really
going to invert Hegel, he must show us how material conditions shape our ideas (and
not the other way around). Indeed, this is precisely what he argues.
 
The mode of production which characterizes a time, for Marx, forms the
‘base’ of society. Because this is the dominant underlying system governing our
society, everything else about our lives must grow in around it and conform to it. For
instance, the idea (common in our own time) that college education is primarily for
the purpose of securing a career is a consequence of limits placed on us by the capitalist mode of production. Our society claims that public education is a right not
because of abstract principles about the power of learning and human agency, but
 
535 because the diversification of the workforce under capitalism has meant that we need
ever more specialized workers with ever more advanced training. Because we then
develop our views about education in accordance with capitalism, by the time we
arrive at college, we have been brought into thinking about education in terms of the demands of the market. Marx thinks a similar story can be told about everything,
from ideas about race, gender, marriage, and family, to art, science, politics, and
beyond. These cultural ideas and the systems that realize them, when taken together,
form the ‘superstructure’ of our society. Because the base sets ideological limits to
our thinking about these things, we begin to develop a superstructure in a certain way, and this structure sets the limits of what we, as individuals, can imagine.
However, the fact that our mode of production is so compatible with and
interwoven into our thinking about everything else means that our thinking about
these things only works to reinforce the seeming necessity and inevitability of capitalism.
 
The defender of capitalism will say that Marx’s conception of communism
runs counter to our ideas about human nature, about our inherent greed, and about
our desire to privilege our own family over others. However, the Marxist will simply say that we only have those ideas about human nature and family because we
currently live under capitalism. Because this way of thinking does not come from a
genuinely free society, in which some class isn’t exploiting another, it represents (in
Marx’s view) a kind of false consciousness. The only genuinely true way of thinking
is one which makes such a society possible: class consciousness. Thus, while Marx has completed his inversion of Hegel, it still maintains a striking similarity to Hegel’s
picture; history develops through stages of conflict which ultimately aim to lay the
groundwork for a universally true and free mode of consciousness. Marx’s central
change to this picture is his grounding it in the practical and material affairs of our lives. Rather than relying on the geist to reveal itself through some important world
historical individuals, Marx puts the power into the hands of the masses. As he
 
536 famously says himself, “the philosophers have only interpreted the world in various
ways; the point is to change it.”199 
 
Søren Kierkegaard 
 
The thinkers we have so far addressed from the period share a few things in
common. First and foremost, they are critics of the societies that they inhabit. They
are also careful students of modernity. By the 19th century, the Enlightenment
projects of mechanical philosophy and rationalism had birthed a scientific, political, and religious revolution. While romantics like Goethe, Schiller, and Hamann had
pushed back against the ordering of the self, along with the social and natural worlds,
their effect was not enough to stall the steady march of progress. Indeed, Hegel had,
in effect, turned rationalism into a religion. Hegel’s idealism saw history as a grand
and predestined process bringing about a new, almost utopian world of genuine freedom and cosmic self-understanding. Yet, this did little to stop Marx from
looking around at Europe’s rapid industrialization and capitalism’s factory lines and
wondering whether Hegel got things exactly right. Yet, Marx’s skepticism was still
not enough for him to abandon the messianic character of Hegel’s philosophy; we are making progress and there is a better world ahead. The key difference between
Hegel and Marx was really just a dispute over whether it is ideas or material
conditions which propel this process forward. With the introduction of Søren 
Kierkegaard, we have a thinker who will push back further against Hegel than
Marx was willing to do. It is not just that rationalism has oversold its case, the entire project of modernity itself may not make our lives easier or better. In effect, the line
of thinking borne out of Athens and carried through to the present age is a kind of
affliction which, in the eyes of Kierkegaard, can only be solved by turning back (with
fresh eyes) to faith. While his devout religiosity will only cause him to stand further

537 out as we move through history, his recognition of the very human situation we find
ourselves in within modern life will serve as a great inspiration to a number of 20th
century thinkers, secular and religious alike.
 
Kierkegaard was the youngest of seven children born into a wealthy Danish
family in the capital city of Copenhagen. His father worked as a merchant and had initially hired Kierkegaard’s mother as a maid before ultimately marrying her.
Kierkegaard’s father was also something of an intellectual. He was deeply invested in
rationalist philosophy, inviting philosophers to their home and celebrating the work
of Christian Wolff. These interests meant that Kierkegaard was introduced to philosophy from a very young age, reading the works of Plato, but also modern
German-language writings by Hamann and Lessing. Yet, the strongest influence on
the young Kierkegaard’s outlook was not Socrates (though he was a close second).
Instead, it was his father’s religiosity, which existed alongside his rationalism, that had the greatest impact. Indeed, his father is said to have believed that none of his
children would outlive him as a consequence for having cursed God in his youth.
This would turn out to be partially, but not entirely accurate, as five of the children
did not survive past the life of their father. While this so strongly influenced Kierkegaard toward a path of religious learning that he decided to attend the
University of Copenhagen in order to study theology, he was actually more
interested in understanding religion through personal contemplation rather than
books. Yet, while he left the university and soon thereafter earned the ability to work as a Lutheran priest, he would not join the clergy. Instead, Kierkegaard met and
quickly fell in love with a young woman named Regine Olsen. Kierkegaard’s feelings
were deeply reciprocated, and the two became engaged to get married. However,
Kierkegaard eventually called off the wedding because he believed that he was too
depressed (or ‘melancholic’) to ever make a woman truly happy. Not wanting to inflict a life of sorrow on the woman he most loved, he attempted to persuade her
not to marry him. While she was still enthusiastically supportive of the idea of
marriage, Kierkegaard briefly attempted to pretend that he was a bad person who
simply never actually cared for her. When this didn’t work, he fled to Berlin and attempted to escape the public embarrassment of the entire ordeal.
 
In Berlin, Kierkegaard remained incredibly productive. He published at least
ten major works over a three-year period. These texts now show signs of Kierkegaard
 
538 attempting to communicate with Regine secretly through his writings, hoping to
convince her of both the earnestness of his love for her and the necessity of calling
the wedding off. However, his life soon turned upside down when he became
embroiled in a messy and public dispute. When Kierkegaard published a letter critical of a young scholar, the satirical magazine The Corsair responded by a
publishing a series of personal attacks on him. These attacks became increasingly
personal as well, with The Corsair ridiculing his appearance. This feud, which has
come to be known as the “Corsair affair” drove the already melancholic Kierkegaard
into seclusion. While he had previously enjoyed long walks around the city, he was now met in public with ridicule and crowds of judgmental staring people. Yet, once
again, he was able to convert this isolation and sadness into yet another period of
incredible productivity. After lying low and continuing to publish works,
Kierkegaard reemerged into public life by dedicating himself fulltime to a war against the state church of Denmark. At this point, Kierkegaard had established himself as a
deeply religious thinker and a critic of secular life, so the dispute mostly concerns
specifics about the Danish church. Two years after initially starting this conflict, the
stress apparently got to him when Kierkegaard, age 42, collapsed on the street. By the time that he arrived at the hospital, he was paralyzed and, within several weeks, he
had died (apparently of tuberculosis). Yet, in his wake, Kierkegaard left an enormous
body of works for future scholars to pour over, with the project of interpreting these
writings made even more difficult by the fact that they were authored under a number of different pseudonyms. Today, scholarship is divided on the extent to
which these various pennames actually represent his view, and whether a single
unified Kierkegaard even exists.
 
As we have already said, Kierkegaard’s philosophy is very much informed by
his religious views, but it is also as much a reaction to the circumstances which we find ourselves in in modern life. Whereas Marx was still attempting to give us an
account of human nature (like so many great philosophers before him), Kierkegaard
shifts his focus to a reframing which will come to define much of the modern
Continental philosophical tradition. Instead of seeking some essential character of what it means to be a human, Kierkegaard is interested in the human condition.
Perhaps there is little to nothing about us, as individual beings, which ties us together
and separates us from other animals. After all, humans can be so many different
 
539 ways. However, all of these very different humans still find themselves in a similar
predicament, facing similar challenges, and for similar reasons. This is the human
condition, and Kierkegaard thinks it can be best understood in the concept of
anxiety. While he is, in many ways, talking about the same thing that our modern clinical definition of anxiety is describing, the account he gives is different in some
key ways. Kierkegaard notices that anxiety is quite similar to fear. For instance, we
view both negatively, as something to be resolved. Indeed, if we told our therapist
that we were feeling anxious, then they might ask what, exactly, we are afraid will
happen. However, Kierkegaard argues that fear is always directed at something; the question is what we are afraid of. By contrast, he claims that anxiety does not point at
any one thing in particular. Instead, it is the natural feeling of our own human
freedom. Anxiety is the emotional recognition of the situation we find ourselves in.
When we must choose whether or not to cheat on an exam, or whether not to turn ourselves in afterward, we are confronted by not only a variety of possibilities, but
also by the fact that they are possibilities we can and must choose from. Free choices
like this are an awesome part of living a human life, but they are also a terrible
burden. We find ourselves constantly in a situation in which we are forced to make a choice and to take responsibility for it. Choices like this cause us to ‘zoom out’ and
take bird’s eye view; we want to get outside of ourselves, take an objective point of
view, and impartially determine what the ‘right’ choice is. Kierkegaard describes the
feeling of doing this, anxiety, as akin to a kind of dizziness.
 
An obvious answer to what we ‘should’ do is the one offered by the
hedonist: pursue our own pleasure and self-interest. Often, this is the first and most
natural impulse of people. Children, for instance, are driven primarily by their own
pleasure, and Kierkegaard says that people who do this inhabit the ‘aesthetic sphere’.
Consuming the best art we can find, the finest food, and the best music can be great for a while. However, life in the aesthetic sphere ends up more complicated than
mere hedonism. Here, we act in our own self-interest and from our own point of
view. We are the ultimate judge, jury, and executioner of what is good for us to do.
In some ways, the privileging of the subjective and natural can be seen as in line with Kierkegaard’s German romanticist predecessors. Yet, Kierkegaard thinks that most
people will eventually grow tired of this kind of life. When we move through the
world simply using everything and everyone around us as a means to our own
 
540 interests and pleasures, we have no real attachments. We have, in effect,
instrumentalized everything; nothing is valuable for its own sake. Thus, finally
accomplishing a goal we’ve worked hard at is only rewarding because our desire to do
it has been satisfied. The question we are left with, is what should we do? Is there anything that we can do or accomplish that will give us a sustained sense of meaning,
purpose, and value beyond the fact that it happened. What, exactly, is worth doing?
 
In asking this last question, we have moved from the aesthetic sphere and
into the ‘ethical sphere’. Here, we shift from the merely subjective to the objective.
Instead of merely living a life that consists of little more than a series of fleeting pleasures, we attempt to carve, out of these moments, a single unified story about
ourselves. What are we working towards? Often, projects that fall into the ethical
sphere also involve other people. If we seek meaning and value in being a father,
rather than simply having a number of fun times, we open ourselves up to others (e.g., a co-parent and our child). Whereas we could simply be our own judge of
whether an activity was pleasurable or not in the aesthetic sphere, to unify ourselves,
we must subject ourselves to the judgments of others. After all, whether or not a slice
of cake was a good dish is up to us, but whether or not someone is a good father is, in large part, up to their kids. The world of possibilities presented to us in the aesthetic
sphere becomes a world of choices and tasks and making sense of all these choices
requires that we start theorizing about what makes things valuable at all. This is
where philosophy and religion come in. Christianity, Confucianism, Consequentialism, and Kant all offer us procedures for choosing. However, the
consequentialist and the Kantian really have little to say to one another. While we
can motivate ourselves to find one more appealing than the other (and vice versa),
these philosophical systems don’t seem to be able to resolve the matter one way or
the other. How do we argue someone into thinking that consequences matter more than intentions? These are, in many ways, value judgements. Each person must
decide for themselves how much to weigh their values against one another, and there
is no clear rational basis for choosing one as the ultimate and correct view. This is, in
Kierkegaard’s estimation, Hegel’s great mistake. Hegel had essentially built up a religion around rationality and yet, whether not we should value rationality itself is
not something rationality alone can answer. This recognition, that despite our best
efforts to achieve, through rationality, an objective point of view, we must still make
 
541 a fundamental and nonrational choice, moves us out of the ethical sphere and into
the religious sphere.
 
There are two ways to come into the religious sphere: as a ‘knight of infinite
resignation’ or as a ‘knight of faith’. To illustrate this, Kierkegaard carefully examines
the Biblical story of Abraham and Isaac. Abraham lives his life according to a covenant with God. God promised him a male heir and that male heir does not come
for most of Abraham’s life. However, in old age, Abraham is given his promised son
in the form of Isaac. We should recognize that Isaac must mean the world to his
father, he has waited and waited faithfully fulfilling his duty to God in the hopes of one day seeing a son and that son has finally come. However, just as soon as God
gives Abraham his son, he seemingly takes him away. Abraham is told by God that he
must sacrifice the son he was promised. Mournfully, Abraham complies, preparing
to eventually kill his son. Yet, just as Abraham was close to completing his task, God stays his hand and tells Abraham that Isaac can live. The question facing Kierkegaard
is what lesson we should draw from this. To answer this, Kierkegaard imagines two
attitudes that Abraham could have taken, one of faith and one of resignation. If
Abraham acted out of resignation (that is, as a knight of infinite resignation), he would have resigned himself to the fact that he was going to lose his son. However,
he would simply think that this is a sacrifice for the greater good; that serving God
compensates for his son’s death. Indeed, he might conclude that his earthly
happiness is outweighed by the happiness of the afterlife, and that while he surrenders his son in the here and now, he will be reunited for eternity. However,
what we should really aim for is to live as a knight of faith. If Abraham acted out of
faith, and not resignation, he would not have resigned himself to losing his son.
Indeed, if killing Isaac is the best possible outcome all things considered, then his
death is really no sacrifice at all. According to this story, God does not demand that we sacrifice the here and now for eternal reward in the afterlife. Instead, Abraham
would act out of faith that God will give him his son back in this life. Since God has
not told him this directly, it requires that Abraham take a leap of faith. Abraham
doesn’t rationally conclude that killing his son will produce the greatest possible outcome for the greatest number of people. Instead, he goes beyond the rational and
makes a choice that he will take responsibility for. This is the faith that we are
supposed to model as knights of faith, and it shows us the necessity of overcoming
 
542 our anxiety in the face of choices, not resigning ourselves to the limits of rationality
(which ultimately can’t fully tell us what to do). We must, in Kierkegaard’s view,
choose for ourselves to realize the freedom of our humanity and take responsibility
for whatever comes from it.
 
Friedrich Nietzsche 
 
While Kierkegaard did, in many ways, predict the direction that continental
philosophy was moving going into the 20th century, it is another philosopher (one who shares a great deal in common with him) that comes closest to rivalling Marx in
bringing that century about. Here, the impact and lasting importance of Friedrich Nietzsche is hard to match. However, Nietzsche also has more in common with
Marx than mere popular influence. He, like Marx, also stands out as among the most
often and most catastrophically misunderstood thinkers of all time. While he was an atheist, his conclusion that “God is dead” has served as a foil to a great many religious
adherents who misunderstand his point altogether. In the same way, while he was
certainly not an egalitarian, his apparent popularity among the Nazis (of both the
original and neo variety) suggests that we should read him, unfairly, as a politically destructive and fascistic thinker. We can also add to this the fact that Alfred
Hitchcock’s 1948 film Rope has two men, modeled on the real-life story of Leopold
and Loeb, murder another for no other reason than the mere fact that they think the
writings of Nietzsche tell them that superior people such as themselves can and
should do whatever they want, murder included. In light of all of these tragic and fundamental misunderstandings of Nietzsche’s thought, our project becomes one of
untangling what exactly he actually did think and why.
 
Nietzsche was born in the small village of Röcken in Prussia (on the Eastern side of modern-day Germany). His father, a Lutheran minister, died when Nietzsche
was just five and Nietzsche’s younger brother died only a few months after that. This
left the young Nietzsche, along with his sister, in the care of his mother, who moved
them into his grandmother’s house, where they would live with Nietzsche’s two
unmarried aunts. Soon, he managed to secure enrollment at a prestigious school,
 
543 where he quickly immersed himself in the poetry of Hölderlin and Christian
theology. He learned Latin, French, Greek, and Hebrew, as well as the piano, and
quickly earned a reputation as a brilliant student. Eventually, he made his way to the
University of Bonn, where he informed his mother that he would study philology (or the development of ancient languages) rather than follow in his father’s
theological footsteps as she had hoped. Nietzsche’s excellence in working with
ancient texts meant that he only lasted a year at Bonn before following one of his
professors to the University of Leipzig. Within five years of beginning his university






education, and at the age of 24, Nietzsche landed a job as a professor at the University of Basel in Switzerland. There, Nietzsche’s infatuation with the
romanticism he first encountered in Hölderlin only grew. He maintained a
friendship with the composer Richard Wagner, who at the time was much older, and
it is often said that Wagner played something of a father figure for him. However, this friendship and mutual respect soon came crashing to an end when Nietzsche
became disillusioned with Wagner’s constant mythologizing and celebration of
German culture.
 
For sometime after his falling out with Wagner, Nietzsche filled this void with Schopenhauer, whose works he had encountered as a young student in Basel.
He admired Schopenhauer’s thorough going materialism but hoped to create a
philosophy that found a more optimistic conclusion than Schopenhauer had. He
kept at this project for some time (perhaps the rest of his life), but eventually faced a number of simultaneous yet distinct health problems. Between these and his own
differences with the field of philology, Nietzsche managed to retire from the
university at a mere 34. He followed this by spending his time travelling around the
Mediterranean, remaining incredibly productive while also in search of a climate
conducive to his increasing health needs. It was during this time that he also fell in
love with Lou Andreas-Salomé.200 He continuously and repeatedly proposed marriage to Salome while she continued to refuse him while she struggled to preserve their friendship. This situation was only made more complicated by the constant
intrusion of his sister into the matter, who desperately did not want the two to
 
200 Salome was a considerable philosopher in her own right, in addition to being a psychoanalyst. Her work draws on both Nietzsche and Freud (who was, himself, inspired by Nietzsche), providing an account of female sexuality and a psychology of narcissism. 
 
544 marry. By the end of the entire ordeal, Nietzsche had managed to isolate himself
from Salomé, his friends, and his sister. He spent the next several years writing and
fighting for control of his published works after he broke off his relationship to his
publisher over the issue of antisemitism, which Nietzsche detested. It was at this point that Nietzsche’s mental health began to decline. Famously, the turning point
in his life is said to have been an incident in which Nietzsche confronted a man on
the streets of Turin (in Italy) because he was beating his horse. After embracing the
horse, Nietzsche collapsed to the ground and the police were called. Nietzsche
immediately followed this up with a series of strange and erratic letters, in which he claimed that the Emperor of Germany should be executed, that Germany should be
invaded by all of the other major powers of Europe, that the Pope should be jailed,
and that all antisemites should be shot dead. He soon came under the care of doctors
and became unresponsive. Meanwhile, his now estranged sister, who had left Germany with her antisemitic husband to establish a German colony in Paraguay,
returned to oversee his large unpublished literary estate. Despite her best efforts,
through private tutoring, to understand her brother’s work, she was never able (by
her own estimation) to learn any philosophy. This did little to stop her from compiling, editing, and publishing his work after his death (said to be from syphilis,
but more likely the result of brain tumor). These works, especially The Will to 
Power, bear the marks of the enormous liberties she took in altering his thoughts. In
particular, her edits clearly attempted to make Nietzsche sound like he agreed with the, then rising, Nazi party, whom his sister shared sympathies. It was this work that
both Nazi’s and the murderers Leopold and Loeb pointed towards to justify their
own behavior and, accordingly, much his negative reputation seems more properly
deserved by his sister, whose own funeral was attended by Adolf Hitler.
 
As we have already said, Nietzsche’s philosophical project is, in many ways, one of optimistically addressing the view of the world offered to us by
Schopenhauer. By the time of Nietzsche’s writing, the Enlightenment, the Scientific
Revolution, and modernity itself had radically upended the way that his audience
thought about the place of humans in the world. The preceding several hundred years had been a story of religion’s slow and steady loss of authority. The number of
Europeans who were living what were, for all practical purposes, atheistic lives, was
already quite high and only getting higher. Added on top of this was the recent
 
545 emergence of Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection. For a long time,
people had contented themselves to think of humans as the unique and special
creation of God, tasked with governing the natural world and divinely granted
rationality in order to better understand God’s commands about how to best do this. However, modernity was beginning to overturn this conception of the world in ways
that those living through it were still struggling to understand. Yet, even as the
intellectual circles that Nietzsche occupied were now predominantly secular, they
still retained something of the flavor of an earlier, more Christian way of life. For
instance, we see in Hegel the view that there is still a plan at work in the world which will ultimately lead to paradise, it is only now the rational plan of the geist rather
than a personal God. The only person seriously grappling with the intellectual and
personal implications of all of these developments is, in Nietzsche’s view,
Schopenhauer.
 
Schopenhauer had seen the world as it actually was, fundamentally
indifferent to human beings. We are, at bottom, material beings, governed by the
same natural laws of cause and effect that dictate that a rock will roll down a hill or
that a fire will burn through a forest. Not only does the picture presented to us by the scientific worldview leave out any possibility of our rationally deliberating and
freely choosing, but it also offers us no plan and no deeper meaning or significance
to the events it presents to us. Schopenhauer saw this situation for what it was and
concluded, contra Hegel, that there was no rationality or value to be found. Nietzsche recognizes that even if an individual person still finds value or truth in
religion, they are still functionally dealing with this same problem. While the
religious can say that they don’t see the world this way, their lives are not really that
different from their secular neighbors. The fact of the matter is that religion now
lacks the force it once had to actually and fundamentally shape our lives. This is the crux of Nietzsche’s conclusion when he tells us that ‘God is dead’. He is not merely
saying that atheism is true (a statement that would not shock his largely secular
audience and would make little sense for him to mean literally given his own views,
as God must exist in order to die). Instead, he is speaking figuratively about a crisis of meaning sweeping across Europe, and about the fact that philosophers had merely
attempted to patch up the holes left by this figurative death of God by appealing to
rationality, whether that was in the form of Kant or in the form of Hegel. They
 
546 wanted to act like nothing had changed when, for Nietzsche, nothing could ever be
the same. The project, then, is one of building meaning back up out of the barren
wasteland that Schopenhauer has given us.
 
Despite how vividly Nietzsche describes this situation, it is not enough to
just say that philosophers have not taken the matter seriously, he must show it. Yet, while he does have a strong distaste for Hegel, Nietzsche ultimately shares in Hegel’s
love of history, even if it leads him to very different conclusions. Here, Nietzsche
describes how morality itself has a history, and what exactly that means. First
Nietzsche asks us to travel back to the Egypt of the Bible. There, as in most of the ancient world, might makes right. The sense of the ruling class (of Pharaohs,
Emperors, Kings, and the like) is that they are actually and fundamentally better
creatures than the people they govern. These apparently superior people are defined
by their courage and strength. They bend the world to their will and extract and enjoy any value they find in it. Ultimately, what it means to be good in this world is
to be effective. After all, Alexander the Great is not known as great because he helps
old ladies cross the street, but because he was able to successfully smash his name
into history with a force and violence such that it would take on legendary form even if all books were destroyed. To the pagans (that is, the polytheists) of the Roman,
Greek, Celtic, Viking, and Egyptian worlds, a good life is one in which the exploits of
our battles translate into songs which echo through the ages; one in which we dash
the blood of our enemies upon the rocks of glory and, by doing so, carve our will upon the world and thereby make a seat for ourselves in the halls of Valhalla, where
we can drink mead alongside our ancestors. Of course, if this is the nature of the
good, then bad is merely good’s opposite. To be bad in the ancient world is to be
ineffective and weak, to live as a slave or peasant drifting about in a breeze we
ultimately can’t even effect. This way of viewing morality (in terms of good and bad)
is what Nietzsche calls master morality. To live in accordance with it is to live according to the deep and abiding human drive to gain and exercise power over the
conditions of our lives.
 
However, imagine living as a Jewish slave in Biblical Egypt. Sure, at first, we might idolize the Pharaoh and the heroes of myth, but eventually something would
have to give. No people can go on, generation after generation, thinking that they
and all of their ancestors are and forever will be destined to a life devoid of greatness.
 
547
To do so is to constantly confront one’s own ineffectualness. It is to crave power by
virtue of your human nature and then to live in ever-present denial of it. As a result,
the slaves would eventually invert the masters’ way of thinking. In fact, it is the slaves
who are good, because they serve others, and are defined by their compassion, work ethic, and selflessness. The social position forced on the slaves would eventually drive
them, in Nietzsche’s view, to believe that they had chosen it. They resented the
masters, but they also resented themselves for their own powerlessness to do
anything to resolve their resentment of the masters. Nietzsche calls this kind of
resentment, which focuses on our own impotence, ‘ressentiment’. Yet, again, the bad is merely the opposite of the good, so the slaves’ ressentiment would also mean that
they develop their own account of it as well. In this case, the cruelty of the masters,
their selfishness, and their greed is what is bad. In fact, these things are evil. This is,
according to Nietzsche, the emergence of slave morality, which views people and actions in terms of good and evil. On this story, we are told that power over the
world (defining goal of the masters) is evil, and that we already have what we truly
need if we could only recognize and cultivate it, the power to deny ourselves.
 
Yet, it is the slave morality of the Jews that will ultimately win out. This way of thinking will see its further expression in Jesus, who councils that the meek will
inherit the Earth, that we should turn the other cheek, and that it is easier for a camel
to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the gates of Heaven.
This view, the total embodiment of slave morality, eventually overtakes Rome and spreads throughout the European world. Slave morality is, in fact, exactly what is lost
through the death of God. Yet, this does not stop the rationalist philosophers of the
modern era from attempting to preserve the distinction between good and evil even
in the absence of God. In Nietzsche’s view, this is precisely what Kant was seeking to
do. Nietzsche finds it all too convenient that the system Kant derives from an exercise of pure rationality just so happens to look identical in its conclusions to the
Christian ethics that dominated German society. In the same way, Nietzsche is
equally skeptical of Hegel’s conclusion that we stand at the highest point in human
history. After all, what are the odds that any given person is living through the end of history. The fact is that, for Nietzsche, we haven’t made the kind of moral progress
Hegel describes us as making. For one thing, our making progress would depend on
our having some shared concept of morality across time. It is not that we and the
 
548 ancients agree about the nature of morality and simply that we know more about
that concept. Rather, it isn’t that the ancients were uninformed, but that they had an
entirely different way of conceiving of things. This seems to raise the question of
what the right way of conceiving of morality is, and this a question Nietzsche thinks we will decide, not discover.
 
Nietzsche’s exploration of what he calls the ‘genealogy of morality’ reveals to
him that morality is merely another technology with a history and, like all
technologies, something that can be iterated and improved upon. Unlike Hegel, he
does not think that we now have a more perfect way of looking at things. In fact, he thinks there are many problems with slave moralities (such as the major monotheistic
religions, Kantianism, and utilitarianism). One of the biggest problems inherent in
all of these views is their focus on selflessness. In religion we subordinate ourselves to
a higher authority, which justifies our putting our own thoughts and feelings second to a bigger picture. Kierkegaard’s knight of infinite resignation doesn’t desire to
sacrifice his son, but does it anyway because he is, first and foremost, a subject to
God. If nothing else, religions are constantly telling their adherents to humble
themselves and to serve others. This isn’t a secret or an accusation on Nietzsche’s part, but a core attraction of the view: these systems capture our sense that being
selfless is good. The same is true of Kantianism and utilitarianism; we must do our
duty because these higher principles demand it of us. Indeed, all of the slave
moralities might hold out someone like Mother Teresa as a model for living a good and moral life. She lived in poverty throughout her life and dedicated herself fully to
serving the worst off. The issue, for Nietzsche, is that this kind of selflessness is
literally selfless. Nietzsche challenges us; if we really think that Mother Teresa is a
model for living a good life, then we are free to go live her life. We can always
renounce all of our possessions and spend the remainder of our years in servitude to others. Yet, the fact that we don’t tells us something informative for Nietzsche. If
morality is about living a good life, then the moral life should be one we would want
to live. Slave moralities are a kind of negation of the self, in which we are
subordinate, and in which our desires for how we want to spend our time are disregarded in favor of something higher and outside of ourselves.
 
While those that embrace a life of slave morality tell us and themselves that
they do it because we ought to be selfless and take pity on the worst-off among us,
 
549 they are really (in Nietzsche’s view), hiding from life. Consider a runner who trains
their whole life in order to make it to the Olympics. There, in the middle of the race,
the runner next to them trips and falls. They are now faced with two choices: they
could stop and help them, forfeiting their chance at victory, or they could keep running and go for gold. Of course, some people do choose the route of slave
morality; they help the person across the finish line to much applause and everyone
in the crowd concludes that there are greater, more important things than winning.
Yet, Nietzsche is skeptical of this story. In fact, it is cowardice that drives someone to
do this. This person has chosen to dedicate themselves and their time fully to training for this very moment. Imagine making the sacrifices it takes to compete at
this level. The runner would have stayed in almost every night instead of going out
with friends so that they could wake up and train in the morning, they would have
forgone thousands of delicious desserts in favor of a dietitian’s recommendations, and they would have lived their life in pursuit of their own idea of greatness.
However, it would be quite tempting to stop and help in the middle of the race, not
out of sympathy but out of fear. Continuing to run is to place all of our choices on
trial according to standards of our own choosing. It may, in fact, turn out that all of these sacrifices were for nothing, when we come in ninth place. The fear of risking it
all in order to achieve greatness is so great that we, like the Biblical slaves, might
simply change our idea of greatness in place of actually confronting our own
powerlessness and attempting to rise above our situation. Perhaps it is actually sportsmanship that is great, not athletic skill. Again, as always, selflessness is merely
an expression of ressentiment, and this is to say nothing of the fact that taking pity
on others requires a kind of condescension in which we take ourselves to be above
them, looking down.
 
If slave morality is fundamentally flawed, then we might conclude that Nietzsche endorses a return to master morality. In fact, this is in many ways how the
Nazis read him. The issue with this is that, while master morality avoids the
particular problems faced by slave morality, it is also not a perfect system. Indeed, it
would be quite strange to say that morality is a technology which can be improved upon and made to work for the society in which it is used, and then to turn around
and go back to an earlier version of it than the one we had originally complained
about. No, in Nietzsche’s view, 19th century problems require 19th century solutions.
 
550
The question, then, is how we can live selfishly without lapsing into the kinds of
behaviors Leopold and Loeb enjoy and without simply reverting to master morality.
How do we preserve a place for ourselves while, at the same time, still being able to
say something to someone who tells us that they have, following Nietzsche’s advice, put their own needs and desires first, and that they desire to murder? The project
that Nietzsche ultimately does endorse is not master or slave morality, but a
revaluation of value, the development of a new morality beyond good and evil.
Each individual must engage in this work and decide for themselves how they should
live their life. However, he does still have advice for us about how to do this, and this advice might also provide us with some guardrails for avoiding a life of murder and
destruction. The answer, in this case, involves a thought experiment which Nietzsche
calls ‘eternal return’.
 
Here, Nietzsche asks us to imagine ourselves at the end of our life. There, in old age and on our death bed, we are visited by a powerful and supernatural being.
This being informs us that at the ultimate heat death of the universe, things will
begin again just as they did before. That is, there will be another Big Bang, another
development of the Milky Way, another creation of our sun, and another spinning off of the earth out of a cloud of rocks and dust. There, life will begin anew and
continue just as it did before, following the exact same path, which eventually leads
to you. At which point, you will be born again and will move through your own life
in the exact same way that you did in this lifetime. You will make every choice over again. Every circumstance that befalls you, for better and for worse, will befall you
again. You will go to college or not in the same way, major in the same thing at the
same university, break up with the same partners and marry the same person. You
will have kids or not in the same way, stay at the same jobs doing the same work every
day in precisely the same way, and you will come to the same end that you now find yourself in once again. What’s more, this will keep happening again and again. The
universe will keep reproducing itself in the exact same way over and over again and,
as a result, you will live the same exact life over and over again as well, forever.
Nietzsche then says there are two ways of reacting to this information, you will either think that the being telling you this is a demon punishing you or a genie giving you a
gift. Nietzsche’s advice is that we should live ourselves in a way that we would be
happy to find this out.
 
551
What can we learn from this? First, Nietzsche thinks that we won’t live a life
defined by slave morality. The thing that motivates people to live these kinds of
selfless lives is that they expect, like the knight of infinite resignation, a reward in the
afterlife. With an eternity of bliss in heaven off the table, people would live very different lives for themselves. However, notice as well that murder is also less
attractive. While the murderer might enjoy getting to live their life according to their
immediate desires for a while, the life sentence they receive would quickly, under
eternal return, become an infinite sentence. In the same way, all of the stress the
murderer feels at possibly being found out would become an infinity of torture. The person who uses eternal return to engage in a revaluation of value will choose a life
for themselves, for their own reasons. While Kant would have us not murder because
the rule is imposed on us from the outside by our moral duty, Nietzsche gives us a
way of choosing for ourselves how to live, and in a way that we would actually want to experience but does at least still have something he can say to the would-be
murderer. The person who does all of this, and who overcomes slave morality and
consciously decides for themselves how to govern their own lives is, in Nietzsche’s
estimation, an übermensch (translated into English as either ‘superman’ or
‘overman’), and to live as an übermensch is the highest good we can hope for.201 
 
Nietzsche’s way of looking at things, which he shares in common with
Kierkegaard despite the enormous differences in their religious beliefs, will have a
profound impact on the way that continental philosophy unfolds in the 20th century. We have come a long way from Aristotle’s essentialism, which told us that
there is something intrinsic that it means to be a human, and that this essential
 
201 Helene von Druskowitz, in an attempt to ‘out-Nietzsche’ Nietzsche, raised him from the concept of an übermensch to the concept of the übersphere (or over-sphere). In this case, Druskowitz argues against Christianity as Nietzsche does, but where Nietzsche believes that most humans fall short of living the life of an übermensch, Druskowitz claims that the same can be said for the entire material world, which falls short of the ideal of an übersphere. In the same way that, for Nietzsche, our failures to move towards the life of an overman is the result of our personal and moral weakness, Druskowitz blames our inability to move towards the übersphere on the shortcomings of men in particular. Another feminist philosopher who is both inspired by but critical of Nietzsche is Hedwig Dohm, who argued similarly that the oppression of women by men creates an additional impediment for women in realizing the kind of project of self-creation that Nietzsche endorses.
 
552 nature provides us with a purpose and guide for life. We find in these thinkers a sense
that if there is a purpose to be found in the world, it will be an active choice, not a
discovery. This idea will be taken up and explored by philosophers at length, and it
will see its fullest expression in the existentialists. However, before we can get there, we must check in on the other side of the philosophical tradition, which is divorced
from continental Europe. Just as Nietzsche can be read as, in many ways, reacting to
the view of the world offered to us by Darwin, the theory of evolution will also play a
central role in the history of philosophy in Britain and America. Further, just as we
saw Hegel setting the agenda in 19th century continental philosophy, the idealists will remain a powerful force which sets the stage for philosophy in the 20th century. This is the situation we turn to now.

555
The Pragmatists 
 
At the same time that Nietzsche was struggling with the implications of
Darwin’s biological revolution, others saw it as a spark of inspiration. In America,
philosophers had begun drawing on the theory of natural selection, bringing it into contact with elements from idealism and utilitarianism, and developing a truly
unique philosophical framework. Of course, we have already seen some philosophy
in the Americas. The indigenous peoples of North, Central, and South America each
have their own philosophical traditions (such as that of the Maya and the Aztecs).  Beyond this, the empiricist George Berkeley spent a considerable part of his life in
colonial America (enough so that they named a town in California and the university
it houses after him, even though they persist in mispronouncing that name). In the
same way, Juana Inés de la Cruz stands out as another active philosopher in the colonial Americas. Finally, we have also already encountered the work of thinkers
like Catherine Beecher, Ellen Bliss Talbot, and Anna Julia Cooper, who were all
active during the time period we now find ourselves in (with Cooper coming a little
later than the others). However, there was another important philosophical development in America during the time between Sor Juana and Nietzsche which
will help set the stage for what is to come: transcendentalism.
 
Transcendentalism stands out as, perhaps, the first true school of
philosophy founded and developed in the United States. In contrast to the truth-
seeking philosophies which have made up the bulk of our discussion so far, transcendentalism shares more in common with way-seeking traditions like that of
their American predecessor, the Aztecs. Where empiricists see the world as a thing
distinct and other than us (an external reality), which can be reflected on in the
mind, transcendentalists like Ralph Waldo Emerson are more likely to see the world in terms of our experience of it. Nature, in particular, offers us the possibility
 
557 of beautiful and meaningful experiences, and the experience of natural beauty can
help to develop us as individuals.202 In turn, for the transcendentalists, this more
authentic way of being in the world should spurn us on to commit ourselves to
moral and social action. This can be seen in the thought of a philosopher like Henry 
David Thoreau, whose work centers on self-development through experiences with
nature, and on the legitimacy of civil disobedience, or the intentional disobeying of unjust laws. However, Thoreau is not alone among the transcendentalists in
channeling philosophy into social action. For instance, Margaret Fuller criticized
Emerson on the basis that his view was too focused on self-development. Instead, her more socially oriented philosophy drove her advocacy of women’s rights. The same
can be said of Lydia Maria Child, whose transcendentalist philosophy brought
her to fight for the causes of abolitionism, indigenous rights, and ‘free-thought’. This
ongoing free thought movement, which we have already seen through the life and work of the utilitarian philosopher Annie Besant, sought to limit the influence of
religion in political and social life. This struggle will also carry over into the work of
some of the philosophers discussed in this chapter.203
 
By the time of the late 19th and early 20th century, the way-seeking influence of the transcendentalists became joined with the emerging forces of idealism, utilitarianism, and Darwin’s theory of natural selection. Recall Berkeley’s argument
against the existence of mind-independent objects. We say that our bed continues to
exist even after we leave it and go to work, and Berkeley asks us how we could know such a thing without going home and perceiving it. This is quite similar to the
argument, put forward by the German idealists, that we might as well not even posit
the things of the noumenal world because they can’t, by definition, play a role in our
 
202 Notice that transcendentalism resembles and was clearly influenced by German romanticism, in its placing such importance on individual experience and natural beauty.  203 While many women philosophers during this period were, like Besant, involved in the free thought movement, others, like Frances Power Cobbe and Catharine Macaulay (discussed in the section on Mary Shepherd), were deeply religious. Another religious woman philosopher of the Victorian era was Caroline Frances Cornwallis, who wrote extensively on the importance of universal education, on rational theology and Christianity, and on feminism. Meanwhile, there were also religious adherents within the transcendentalist movement, including Theodore Parker, who argued that the movement could not be separated from religious belief. 
 
558 best theories. The key move that takes place in American philosophy during this
time is to take the arguments made by these idealists about the nature of reality and
turn them into a theory of truth and meaning. Instead of starting, as the empiricists
do, with a theory of truth (in which the truth is the way that objects actually are in the noumenal world) and saying that science aims at uncovering that truth, these
philosophers argue that we should start with science and simply define truth as
whatever the best way of knowing tells us to believe. The German idealists claim that
we only have reason to posit objects which play some role in our best theories of the
world, and these new American philosophers develop the same thought. It is not that science ought to converge on the independent truth about the world, but that
the truth just is whatever our best explanations require. Still, we might wonder what
grounds science in this case. The promise of science was that it could get us to the
truth and its correspondence to that truth was the ultimate judge of whether it was successful. If it is not correspondence to truth, what makes science our ‘best way of
knowing?’
 
The answer we are given here is the answer which Darwin gives to us about
why the species of the world are the way they are: because it works. Philosophy is, on this view, way-seeking. It seeks to help us get by in the world. It is a tool, a map, not a
mirror of reality. Here, we should notice that maps are not actually judged directly
by their accuracy but by their usefulness. In most of our life, we tend to think these
things are indistinguishable. After all, having an accurate picture of reality is usually useful. However, imagine a perfectly accurate map which captures all of the
beautiful detail of the world.204 A map which loses no resolution in what it is
mapping would, it turns out, have to be the exact same size as the thing it maps. It
would have to be so large that it perfectly covered the entire world. Interestingly, in
order to find anything on this map, we would need yet another map! This shows that maps, as tools, aren’t actually judged by how well they represent reality, but by their
utility. Here we are told that we can judge our beliefs the same way. It is not
correspondence to reality that justifies science, but its utility. With that, we have
 
204 This example, which can serve as a thought experiment for us, comes from the short story “On Exactitude in Science,” by the Jorge Luis Borges. While not himself a philosopher, many of his works speak to philosophical questions and themes, and many of his ideas have been used as allegories or thought experiments within philosophy.  
 
559 taken the utilitarians account of moral value and applied it to epistemic value.
Indeed, this picture tells us that the entire project of philosophy is value-laden. That is, we come to it already valuing something. In contrast to the truth-seeking
philosophies we have seen so far, we can’t attempt to derive what we ought to value from a pure and impartial exercise of reason. Instead, we already have a goal in mind,
and we need a map of the world which can help us towards that goal. Science, it
turns out, is a very successful map. In Darwinian terms, science has survived and
thrived because it is resilient and adaptable, and because it gets us what we want. In
this case, our beliefs operate much as species do, competing amongst one another and are ultimately judged according to their success, not their objective mind-
independent reality, so truth should simply be understood in terms of that kind of
success.
 
However, the representationalist picture of the empiricists, beyond the correspondence theory of truth, also gave us a theory of meaning. Our ideas mean, or
are about, the sense images that are provided by (and correspond to) the objects of
the noumenal world. What, then, is meaning on this account? The American
philosophers of the late 19th and early 20th century take Berkeley’s question “how do you know there is a mind-independent bed there when you leave?” and turn it into
the question “what do you even mean by saying that?” Here, statements are only
meaningful insofar as something hangs on them. Their meaning is a matter of their
‘cash value’. If there is no difference in our practical lives or best explanations between believing that a thing exists and believing that it doesn’t, then that belief is
meaningless, as there is no way to judge its utility. Beliefs must have some skin in the
game, and they will be evaluated based on how well they perform. This very practical
way of looking at philosophical problems has come to be known as pragmatism
(which we first encountered with Mozi in ancient China), and the school of philosophers who endorse this view in America during this time has come to be
known as American pragmatism. The central claims of this school, along with the
many disagreements between its members, will be the focus of this chapter.
 
560
Constance Naden 
 
Perhaps more than anyone, Constance Naden stands out as the figure most embodying the transition from the idealism and utilitarianism that defined the
previous era to the pragmatism which would dominate the next.205 Naden was born
in Birmingham, England, one year before the publication of Darwin’s On the Origin 
of Species. When her mother died only two weeks after her birth, Naden and her father went to stay with Naden’s maternal grandparents. While her father nominally
lived in the house, he is now believed to have spent most of his time living with a new
wife and children from that marriage. This left the young Naden fully in the care of
her mother’s parents. Despite their strong Baptist leanings, Naden was eventually sent to a Unitarian school for her education, where she excelled in painting and
poetry, followed by the local Mason College. As a young woman, she studied the
sciences widely and developed a reputation as a rising and important poet. However,
her artistic endeavors eventually gave way to her philosophical interests when she developed a friendship with the American physician and author Robert Lewins.
Lewins had been a proponent of a philosophical view of his own devising which he
called hylo-zoism, which he had been advocating for in the free-thought newspapers
and magazines of the day (including Annie Besant’s Our Corner). Naden eventually influenced Lewins to refine the view and change the name, bringing in the emerging
biology of the time period. The two would continue to advocate for it, often in
letters to the editor or in journal articles, but few were convinced of its merits. She
wrote and published on topics ranging from ethics, metaphysics, and epistemology,
to aesthetics, geology, and biology.206 When Naden’s grandmother died, she was left
 
205 Another philosopher sitting at this transition point is F.C.S. Schiller, while he would later fully endorse the pragmatist movement that he saw come to fruition, he would eventually focus his efforts on criticizing the uses and, in his estimation, misuses of formal logic.  
206 Naden’s writings on these topics were heavily influenced by Darwin’s theories. For instance, she argued that evolution by natural selection could resolve the paradox of practical reason that Sidgwick and Jones had dealt with and thus bolster utilitarianism. Importantly, Naden was not alone in exploring the ethical implications of evolution, and the conclusions that thinkers were drawing from modern biology vary wildly. On the one hand, Naden draws 
561 as the inheritor of a great deal of money, which she used to fund her travels
throughout India, the Middle East, and North Africa. The twelve years after the
death of her grandmother were incredibly productive, with Naden maintaining an
active publishing career during her time abroad. She also campaigned for women’s suffrage in Britain and for expanding educational opportunities for women in India.
However, this period came to an end when a surgical infection took her life at the
young age of 31. Despite her best efforts to focus on refining and advocating for her
philosophical position later in life, she remained most known in her own time (and
in the time after) for her poetry. This is at least partially due to the fact that she used a number of pennames and aliases when corresponding about philosophy. However,
from our modern vantage point, we see the ways in her work prefigures the
pragmatism to come by attempting to draw together the same set of influences
which inspire them.
 
At first glance, Naden’s hylo-idealism seems to be contradictory. It asserts the truth of materialism (or the position that everything that exists is material) while,
at the same time, also maintaining the truth of metaphysical idealism (or the position
that there are no mind-independent objects). However, Naden’s claims are sophisticated and nuanced, and her position gets at the heart of the debate between
the realists and idealists.207 She approaches her philosophy from the position of first
defending idealism, and then defending the possibility of materialism given idealism.
With regards to the first project, Naden begins by, in some ways, retracing Kant. Here, she presents us with a thought experiment. Imagine a human person very
much like us, except for the fact that all of their perceptual systems had have been
 
on the work of Herbert Spencer, who she is both influenced by and criticizes due to his endorsement of ‘social Darwinism’, or the position that evolution tells us that we ought to promote the interests of the powerful at the expense of the vulnerable. On the other hand, we see the work of Arabella Buckley (who developed an updated evolutionary version of the sentimentalist account of the development of the moral sense) and Antoinette Brown Blackwell (who used Darwin’s theory to argue for the rights of women). She was also not alone among Victorian women in putting forward an aesthetic theory. For instance, Vernon Lee defended a version of aesthetic hedonism focused on embodied engagement with artworks. Meanwhile, Emilia Dilke defended autonomism on the basis of a sensory account of art and aesthetic value.  
207 Recall that realism is the position (shared by idealism’s opponents) that external, mind-independent objects exist.   
 
562 rerouted to through to the olfactory system. Instead of hearing sounds, they receive
the same stimulus that an ear does (the sound of a symphony and the bark of a dog)
and interpret it in terms of smell. The same is true for their sense of sight, touch, and
taste. They are, in effect, a human nose. The realist tells us that we see objects which at least in some way resemble how they are. However, we know that the way that the
human nose and ourselves represent the world would be very different. In fact, all we
can really say is that we both receive a stream of sense data coming in. It’s not even
clear that we would draw the same lines around objects. Just as Kant said that our
perception of the world is already shaped by the categories as it enters our minds, Naden concludes that this applies just as much to the idea that there are even distinct
noumenal objects. The perceived world could just be one continuous stream of data.
 
However, this is so far only an argument for Kant’s transcendental idealism,
not absolute idealism. In order to argue for this metaphysical claim, we need reason to think that the data has no independent existence, not just that we can’t know
about its independent existence. In order to arrive here, Naden first follows in
Hume’s footsteps, by giving us an exhaustive account of all of the kinds of mental
objects. For Naden, the data we are given, when unified by the mind into discrete objects, can be called phenomena. We can contrast these with the inner world of
desires and emotions. Phenomena can then be broken down further into three
categories: 1) feelings, 2) body, and 3) the other or ‘eject’. Feelings, perhaps
counterintuitively, refer to the things we standardly take to be external objects (e.g., trees, dogs, rocks, planets, and protons). What sets these apart from the other kinds
of phenomena, for Naden, is that they don’t obey our volition and their acting on
each other doesn’t directly affect us. We can move our arm as an act of volition, and
a boulder falling on it causes us to feel pain internally. By contrast, we don’t feel pain
when a boulder falls on a tree, nor do we cause these things to move into one another. The second category, which should already be clear from our discussion of
the first, is the body. The various parts of the body (and the unified whole which
they make up) do act according to our volition and events that affect the body affect
us (as we saw in the arm crushing example above). Finally, there are those phenomena which, for all intents and purposes, are like the feelings, but so resemble
the body that we attribute something like a mind to them. This is the other or eject.
Here, Naden has in mind other people’s bodies. They are, for us, feelings like rocks
 
563 and trees, but because of their resemblance to our own body, we are (through a force
of habit) drawn into ascribing minds to them. In her view, our tendency to do this is
not really rationally determined. While this analogy between ourselves and others
may hold up, it just as easily may not. In this way, she treats other minds the way that Hume treats causation or the self, as a thing we can’t help but posit. In turn,
however, we use the same analogy backwards as well. The similarity between our
own body and others allows us to infer that, just as the eject are feelings (in Naden’s
sense) with feelings (in the everyday sense), our own minds are composed of feelings
(in Naden’s sense): in this case, a brain. The bodies and brains of others appear to have minds like our own, so minds like our own are likely to have bodies like those of
others. Yet, how can our minds be caused by our brains if brains are feelings and
therefore mind-dependent. In effect, how do we reconcile Naden’s idealism with her
materialism?
 
Here, Naden points out the way in which the framing of the debate biases
us toward representationalism. The strangeness of idealism comes in large part from
the claim that idealists believe that everything around us is just an idea in our mind;
that there is no external, real, and physical thing called a chair, only an idea of one. However, this isn’t exactly fair. Consider someone saying that a soft serve ice cream
machine has two different kinds of things, chocolate and vanilla. Now, imagine
another person concludes that what everyone is calling chocolate ice cream, in fact,
has no actual chocolate in it. Accordingly, they begin to deny that there is chocolate ice cream at all, as no ice cream has the ingredient required to count. Notice that they
are not saying that there is no difference between the flavors, or that they are both
vanilla, just that the feature we used to use to distinguish the flavors isn’t actually
present, and the two kinds of ice cream must be different in some other way. This is,
for the idealists, precisely what has happened in their debate with the realists. The idealists don’t say that there are only ideas (in the way that realists mean) any more
than the other person was saying that there is only vanilla. They simply think that
mind-independence, like having chocolate as an ingredient, is not a property that
anything has. This does not prevent them from drawing distinctions between different kinds of ice cream or different kinds of ideas. Indeed, we have already seen
that Naden thinks that there are wide variety of kinds of phenomena, which differ by
functioning in a number of different ways. Accordingly, there’s nothing preventing
 
564 us from saying that mind and brain differ in other ways. It isn’t that idealists assert
only one side of a distinction, saying there are only ideas. Instead, they deny the
distinction altogether. In fact, a consistent idealist would simply say that because
there is no distinction between mental ideas and material objects, there is no difference between idealism and materialism. In the end, there is only one type of
thing, a common currency of mind-dependent phenomena, and the problem of
reconciling the mental from the material only arises when we think they are
fundamentally different. In this way, the problem is one for realists to address, not
idealists like Naden. What she asserts does exist can be called matter just as easily as it can be called ideas, and it is the marriage of materialism and idealism that constitutes
her hylo-idealism. Yet, her interest in evolutionary theory and her idealism remains
somewhat separate still (with evolution more fully informing her aesthetics and
ethics). Yet, by the next thinker, the two will merge fully into a new American form of pragmatism.
 
Charles Sanders Peirce 
 
Charles Sanders Peirce was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where his father worked as a professor of astronomy at Harvard University. He was introduced
to philosophy at a young age through the study of logic after reading his brother’s
textbook when he was twelve years old. Between this, his father’s many academic
visitors, and the fact that his mother was the daughter of the state’s former senator
meant that the young Peirce was exposed to a great deal of learning throughout his life. However, in his early teens, he was diagnosed with a form of chronic pain, now
know at trigeminal neuralgia. The disorder is said to be among the most painful, and
sharp and persistent pains could be brought about by the slightest touch to the face.
Indeed, the pain is so severe that it is sometimes simply referred to as ‘suicide disease’ due to the frequency with which patients suffer from depression, anxiety, and
suicidal ideation. The emotional consequences for Pierce, throughout his life, were
quite similar, with him being prone to intense depression and anger as a result of the
pain. While he was seen as an incredibly gifted young man, this turned to arrogance and boredom during his time as a student at Harvard. Harvard also represented the
 
565 first point in Pierce’s life when he had been told to study what was expected of him
rather than merely what he wanted. As a result, he limped along at the bottom of his
class while completing his bachelor’s and master’s degrees there. Upon graduation,
having alienated himself from many at the institution, Pierce found it difficult to find academic employment. Instead, he drew on his father’s political connections to
secure a job for the U.S. Coastal and Geodetic Survey. In this role, Peirce was a
pioneer. He soon had a sizeable reputation as a researcher and parlayed that into
making connections within philosophy (and, in particular, logic). However, without
philosophical employment, Pierce was forced to publish his few philosophical works in scientific magazines like Popular Science Monthly. These articles, which often
focused on epistemology, formal logic, and philosophy of language, did eventually
open up an opportunity for him to work as a philosopher at Johns Hopkins
University.208 Unfortunately, when it was found out that Peirce’s wife had left him after he had carried out an affair, Peirce’s job was eliminated just as quickly as it came
about. At the same time, political pressure at the U.S. Coastal and Geodetic Survey
mounted. Peirce’s father’s connections had protected him from the consequences of
his prickly demeanor and with his father’s passing, accusations of nepotism abounded. In the end, Peirce died basically penniless, surviving on the donations of
friends and family and eating mostly old stale bread that was given to him by a local
baker.
 
Peirce sets up his theory of truth by returning to the source of all our modern concerns about it: Descartes. Descartes sent philosophy int a tailspin with
his methodology of radical doubt. For him, to truly know something was to have a
foundational kind of certainty which we could both build on and which we could
not doubt. Further, Descartes went so far as to claim that we couldn’t even have this
 
208 Pierce’s interest in philosophy of language was not unusual during this time period. For instance, the English feminist philosopher and writer Julia Wedgewood also explored the implications of Darwin’s theories for philosophy of language. Meanwhile, Victoria Welby also drew on Darwin to develop a philosophy of language in which meaning is subdivided into sense, meaning, and significance. The same is true for Peirce’s pioneering work in formal logic. Christine Ladd-Franklin, herself a student of Peirce’s and the first American woman to receive graduate-level instruction on the topic, developed an evolutionary theory of color vision along with an early version of a truth table (a topic which we will explore more in discussing the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein in the “Analytic Philosophy” chapter). 
 
566 kind of knowledge about whether the external world even exists. Accordingly, it is
with Descartes’ doubt that Pierce begins to set things in philosophy right again.
Here, Peirce asks whether Descartes even doubted all this in the first place. In a
certain academic sense, Descartes used doubt as a methodology, but he didn’t actually doubt the existence of the external world. Indeed, Pierce wonders whether
such a thing is even possible. To actually doubt something is to be in a certain
psychological state. When we have a doubt, we feel unsettled, and we want that
feeling to be resolved. Doubt compels us to investigate with the hopes that we can
settle ourselves once more. This is, for Pierce, its characteristic feature. We can contrast this with belief, which is settled within us and informs our behavior but
does not motivate us in the same way. The goal then of philosophy, for Peirce is to
fix our beliefs; that is, to resolve our doubts into settled beliefs. The process of doing
this is what Peirce means when he talks about inquiry. If this is right, then philosophy can’t solve questions like whether the external world exists, because there
is no actual doubt to resolve. In this way, it is no real problem at all, and not
admitting of an answer. However, this picture also tells us more. While Descartes
had hoped for a permanent and perfect certainty, inquiry does only and can only aim at settling our opinion. Of course, our opinions might be settled for a while, until
new evidence causes the doubt to arise again. As a result, the most we can say about
truth is that it represents the end of inquiry. Here, truth is the end of inquiry in the
sense that Aristotle and Hegel used the word ‘end’. It is the purpose and final goal of our inquiring. However, at the same time, it would (like Hegel’s end of history) also
be final in a real sense. The truth is simply whatever view survives once all rational
people have settled on a belief. Yet, we would still not be sure of the truth in the way
that Descartes’ foundationalism demands. Even this settled opinion of all is subject to newer and newer evidence, and it is in principle always revisable. Because,
according to Pierce’s story, no beliefs could ever be justified in a fully conclusive way,
he is said to endorse a form of fallibilism.
 
With this view of truth in mind, we can now turn to what the best method
of inquiry is. How should we fix our beliefs? A natural first stab at this would be to
say that we should just believe whatever we want. Peirce calls this the method of tenacity. This certainly has its advantages. For one thing, it can resolve my doubts
quite quickly. As soon as a new doubt arises, we can simply believe whatever makes
 
567 us the happiest and hang onto it with dear life. The problem, for Pierce, is that we
are social creatures, and using the method of tenacity will lead us into all kinds of
problems getting along with one another. For instance, it might make you happy to
believe that your favorite celebrity crush is also madly in love with you, or that you are the once and future ruler of the Roman Empire. However, when you finally meet
your crush, it turns out that they don’t have the same beliefs as you about their love
life, because something else makes them happy. In the same way, your belief that you
are the rightful heir to the throne of the Roman Empire will likely be shaken when
you encounter the long line of other claimants. Inevitably, there will be conflicts and these conflicts will, just as a psychological fact, draw you into doubting your beliefs.
It appears that we need some way of coordinating our beliefs.
 
The natural next step is what Peirce calls the method of authority. All we
need in order to settle everyone’s beliefs on the same page is one central authority figure who can instruct people on what they should believe. The problem is that this
method only ensures coordination for a short time. This is because a central
authority can only weigh in on so many things. If we want to know whether Jesus is
a God or a person, half or fully both, we can ask the Pope. The same can be said for what happens to the souls of the unbaptized and the wafers which we have blessed
during our communion. The issue is that that the Pope has likely not provided us
with answers to our other pressing problems, like where we left our keys and whether
or not we have unsalted butter at home. This will inevitably lead us to try other ways of settling our beliefs, and the beliefs we form on our own will not all be the same.
Eventually, people will begin to piece together their own worldview which will come
into conflict with the story we were told to accept on authority. Once this happens,
we are right back where we started with the method of tenacity.
 
A third and better system for fixing our beliefs would be the method of 
agreeableness to reason. This is, in effect, what we have seen throughout rationalist philosophy. Here, each person is to judge for themselves what makes sense (or is
agreeable to reason). Philosophy done in this way does seem to, despite not relying
on an authority, generate considerable agreement. People are often convinced by the reasoning of others in ways that suggest that rules govern our independent thinking.
What’s more, we can use this method on all manner of problems. This apparent
utility and regularity make it a very successful way of fixing belief. However, we have
 
568 already seen a significant amount of disagreement between philosophers about what
is true and real. In Pierce’s view, as in Hume’s, the rational dog is wagged by the
passionate tail. Philosophy throughout history has been subject to differences of
taste and disposition despite its best efforts to impartially capture the truth. There is also no guarantee that what is agreeable to reason will reflect the everyday problems
we have in the physical world. Indeed, we saw as early as the Presocratic Eleatic
school the claim that reason tells us that an arrow cannot actually move. Theory is
good in practice in theory, but theory is not always good in practice in practice. A
genuine understanding of something requires not only having an everyday grasp on it, and not just the analytical understanding offered by philosophy, but a third level
of clarity. In this case, Peirce tells us that the greatest understanding we can have of
something is to be able to grasp the entire body of practical implications the view
might have. Our beliefs are most settled when we know the entirety of all of a belief’s consequences. This, in turn, requires of us that we understand how the theory relates
to the practice, and for that we need hands-on experience. Peirce calls this principle,
that a full understanding of something means grasping all of its implications, the
pragmatic maxim, and he thinks it encourages us to adopt the fourth and final
method of inquiry: the method of science. Science can coordinate beliefs among people like a priori philosophy, and it can speak to new and minor doubts that may
arise (unlike the method of authority). However, it also has the distinct advantage
that it provides us with ways of testing and verifying our beliefs in practice. For this reason, Peirce endorses the method of science as our best method of fixing belief and
therefore ending inquiry in settled opinion.
 
William James 
 
While Pierce is the first philosopher to refer to himself as a pragmatist, it is
another philosopher (and a fellow Harvard student) who will eventually take ownership of the name. Indeed, the term’s association with this philosopher would
become so great that Pierce eventually relented and asked his view to be called
‘pragmaticism’ instead, to avoid confusing their ideas with his own. This story is
 
569 telling, not only because it gestures towards the importance of this second
pragmatist, but also because it demonstrates the degree of difference between various
pragmatist philosophers. In either case, it is William James who would come to be
synonymous with the position and, in the minds of many, best embody the school.
 
James was born into a wealthy family in New York City. His father, Henry James Sr., was a well-connected theologian who was involved in the cause of
abolitionism and, like Annie Besant and Karl Marx, was an interested participant in
the development of a utopian socialist commune. He was also a friend and
intellectual fellow-traveler of transcendentalists like Thoreau and Emerson (with Emerson being William James’ godfather). This scholarly homelife evidently had an
effect on Henry Sr.’s children, with William James’ brother Henry James going on to
be an important and influential novelist and their sister Alice eventually gaining
notoriety after the publication of her diary, which established her as a witty feminist social critic. Throughout William’s childhood, the family split their time between
America and Europe, providing him with the opportunity to learn German and
French at a young age. Despite his own interest in painting, his father expected of
him that he would become a physician. The two reached a compromise when James decided that he would specialize in the emerging science of psychology at Harvard
University. There, he met and befriended fellow pragmatist Charles Sanders Peirce
(with James being one of those friends which Pierce would end up relying on
financially at the end of his life). Like Peirce, James suffered from health issues, and also like Pierce, this experience drove him into a severe depression which brought
him suicidal ideations for months at a time. Yet, despite this adversity, James
completed his undergraduate degree at Harvard along with a medical degree, pausing
his study only to embark on an ill-fated exploratory trip through the Amazon
rainforest during which he was also afflicted with a number of health issues. Upon completion of his education, James made his way through a number of positions as a
faculty member at the institution, teaching a few notable students, including future
U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt and the novelist Gertrude Stein.209 During his long
 
209 Among James’ other influential students, we find both fellow pragmatists W.E.B. Du Bois and Alain LeRoy Locke (who are the subjects of the next section) and Mary Whiton Calkins. Calkins’ work in philosophy of time argued that we fundamentally misunderstand 
570 and productive tenure there (teaching anatomy, psychology, and philosophy), he
also served as the fourteenth president of the American Psychological Association
and made major contributions to both psychology and philosophy.
 
As we have already said, James’ pragmatism is quite different from
Peirce’s; so different, in fact, that Peirce renamed his view in order to not be associated with James. What, then, is James’ account of truth and meaning? While
the two share a number of commonalities (for instance, justifying our beliefs
according to their utility and endorsing forms of fallibilism), James’ approach is, in
some ways, more individualistic. Peirce defined truth in terms of the end of inquiry, the hypothetical state at which all reasonable inquirers have satisfactorily resolved all
doubts. Notice that even if you had resolved all of your own doubts, you could still
not say that you had the truth, on Pierce’s account, until every other rational
inquirer came to the same conclusion. This is because the fact that they doubt what you believe will itself generate doubt. One of you mut be wrong and, accordingly,
your belief has now been called into question. The only way to resolve this is either
for you to adopt their doubts, thereby reopening the inquiry, or for you to relieve
their doubts, at which point we really do have an end of inquiry. By contrast, James tells us that to say that a belief is true, it must merely ‘agree’ with three things: 1)
matters of fact, 2) relations of ideas, and 3) the other truths we are committed to.210
As long as experience does not offer us contrary evidence as a matter of fact, reason
does not contradict it, and it doesn’t conflict with the other beliefs we hold to be true, then we can say that it is true. By including this third criterion, that our beliefs
ought to work together, James’ account can be said to be a version of the coherence 
theory of truth.211 In contrast to the correspondence theory, which views truth as a
 
time by employing analogies in terms of space (such as the linear and cyclical theories of time), and her work in psychology elaborated a theory of the self and the scientific study of it. This work would lead to her being the first woman President of the American Psychological Association and the of the American Philosophical Association. 210 Notice that conditions one and two recall the terminology of David Hume. 211 The coherence theory of truth will famously be elaborated and defended by the American philosopher Willard van Orman Quine, who plays an important role in pushing 20th century American philosophy back towards pragmatism. More can be read about Quine and his coherence theory of truth in the “Analytic Philosophy” chapter.  
 
571 matter of our ideas matching up with the things they are about, the coherence theory
tells us that true beliefs cohere with the rest of our beliefs.
 
This more individualistic way of thinking about the value of our beliefs
opens up new ways of tackling philosophical problems. In order to demonstrate this,
James uses the example of a camping trip he went on. While there, a few friends gathered to watch a squirrel on a tree. When one person walked around the tree, the
squirrel moved away from and stayed ever ahead of them, circling the tree. This
continued until the person made it all the way around the tree and back to where
they started, never directly seeing the back of the squirrel. A debate then emerged about whether the person had ‘gone around the squirrel’. Some said that they had
because they had gone all the way around the tree and the squirrel was on the tree.
Others said that they hadn’t, because they were never at a point of being directly
behind the squirrel. James’ answer was, as we might expect, a pragmatic one. Whether the person went around the squirrel or not depends on what we mean by
that. There is a sense in which both or true depending on our purposes in asking, and
we might ask either question depending on what information we want to be able to
infer about the situation. As we have said before, meaning for the pragmatists is a matter of the ‘cash value’ of our beliefs, and the cash value here seems to be a matter
of whether we care about their seeing the back of the squirrel or about their circling
it. James’ thinks that we can give similar accounts of many of the philosophical
problems we have struggled with throughout history. By getting clear about what hangs on a debate, we can see that often both parties get at something which is useful
in some context. This renders James’ view a pragmatic kind of pluralism.
 
While James does give examples of how his pragmatic pluralism could be
used to answer a variety of philosophical problems, he is especially well-known for
his work on one topic in particular: philosophy of religion. In order to understand his view, we should start by understanding who he takes to be his opponent. In this
case, James’ discussion is framed in reference to an essay titled “The Ethics of Belief”
by William Kingdon Clifford. There, Clifford tells us a story about a shipowner.
The owner is selling tickets for a trip on his ship across the Atlantic. However, he is aware that the ship is currently in a state of disrepair and may not make it. Yet, fixing
the ship would cost him substantially and would delay the trip, so the shipowner
pushes these doubts aside and goes on selling tickets on the trip. By the time it
 
572 departs, the owner has fully convinced himself, without a single doubt in his mind,
that the ship will make it. When it sinks halfway across the Atlantic, killing everyone
on board, the owner turns around and collects the insurance money covering the
ship. Here, Clifford says that the shipowner is guilty because they had no right to believe that it was safe given the evidence. However, now imagine that the ship had
managed to make it all the way across the Atlantic in its sorry state. While no one
died, his does not change the guilt of the shipowner in Clifford’s eyes; he simply got
lucky after all. Clifford concludes that the shipowner is equally blameworthy in
either case and that this guilt tells us something. Namely, it tells us that it is wrong for anyone to believe anything without sufficient evidence. We can call this rule
Clifford’s principle.
 
James rejects Clifford’s account of the ethics of belief as far too strict. In
fact, James argues, there are contexts in which it is not only perfectly acceptable but morally good to believe something on insufficient evidence. As evidence of this,
consider a mountain climber on a frozen cliff edge. A fracture has formed and
broken off the ice so that the climber is forced to leap a great distance in order to
make it to safety. If the climber leaps with confidence, they will make it. However, if they mistrust themselves, they will likely fall. Here, it is clearly better pragmatically to
adopt a belief that they can make it, even if there is insufficient evidence to conclude
this. If nothing else, we surely can’t say that they are blameworthy for believing in
themselves. This is, for James, the essence of faith; the belief in something which is still theoretically subject to rational doubt. As we might expect, this has implications
within the philosophy of religion. Atheists, unconvinced by the attempts of natural
theology to provide evidence (rather than argument) for the existence of God, have
concluded in many cases that is it not commendable nor rationally permissible to
have faith in his existence without sufficient evidence. Yet, James thinks that he has vindicated faith. In this case, it is the practical and pragmatic value of the belief that
justifies it, rather than evidence, and the fact of the matter is that for many religious
believers, the only practical consequence that hangs on their religious belief is that it
gives them hope. For this reason, James thinks that religious faith can be justified, even if the arguments religious believers have given have still left open the possibility
of doubt.
 
573
W.E.B. Du Bois & Alain LeRoy Locke 
 
Two of William James’ Harvard University students stand out as especially
important figures in the history of American pragmatist philosophy. Yet, despite this
common academic and philosophical heritage, these two thinkers are often cast as
standing against one another, especially within the domain of aesthetics. We are
speaking, here, of W.E.B. Du Bois and Alain LeRoy Locke. Du Bois was born in the predominantly white town of Great Barrington, Massachusetts three years after
the end of the American Civil War. His father left the home when Du Bois was two
years old, leaving Du Bois’s mother to move the family into her parent’s house. The
young Du Bois went on to attend integrated public schools throughout his education and the family’s church raised money for him to attend college, knowing
that the family could not afford to send the clearly gifted Du Bois otherwise. College
education brought Du Bois to the historically black Fisk University in Nashville,
Tennessee, where he encountered Jim Crow laws firsthand for the first time. After completing a Bachelor of Arts at Fisk, Du Bois transferred to Harvard, where he
completed another Bachelor of Arts studying under William James among others.
However, his time in the philosophy department at Harvard pushed him towards
ever more practical pursuits. A travel grant enabled him to go to Germany and study at the Humboldt University of Berlin, where Max Weber was doing pioneering work
in sociology. Upon returning to the United States, he was awarded his PhD from
Harvard in history, becoming the first black student to earn a PhD from the school.
 
After a brief stint teaching classics at Wilberforce University in Ohio, Du
Bois managed to secure employment with the University of Pennsylvania, where he set to work applying the sociological tools he encountered with Weber to study
residents of Philadelphia’s Seventh Ward. However, it was Du Bois’s The Souls of 
Black Folks, published seven years later (while Du Bois was working at Atlanta
University) that catapulted him into international and scholarly fame. Du Bois parlayed this fame into a significant role at the First Pan-African Conference in
London and the 1900 Paris Exposition. His influence within black intellectual circles
also drew him into a dispute with Booker T. Washington (then director of the
Tuskegee Institute) over the proper role of education in black emancipation. Du Bois criticized Washington’s focus on vocational and trade schooling and argued that
 
574 the focus should be on liberal arts and humanities education, because it is what is
most conducive to leadership. This dispute came to a head when Du Bois joined the
Niagara Movement, which opposed Washington’s ‘Atlanta Compromise” (an
unwritten deal in which Southern blacks would submit themselves to the South’s discrimination in exchange for access to basic education, economic opportunities,
and just dealings with the legal system).
 
Du Bois was also central at this point in his life to the establishment of what
would become the NAACP. He used his role, as Director of Publicity and Research
and editor of the organization’s monthly magazine, The Crisis, to push for national laws against lynching, as well as to voice support for unionized labor (while, at the
same time, criticizing the racism common among labor leaders of the time). Du Bois
remained a significant force within American political and social life, bouncing back
and forth between academic positions and employment with the NAACP for many years. He fought tirelessly for the causes of workers’ rights, racial justice,
decolonization, and international peace, even facing a trial by the U.S. Government
during the McCarthy era for possible subversive activity (with the case being
dismissed before Albert Einstein was set to appear as a character witness). Du Bois died at the age of 95, having lived through the presidency of Andrew Johnson and all
the way to the election of Lyndon Johnson. He passed away while in Africa one day
before Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream Speech” was given at the March on
Washington.
 
Du Bois’s philosophical contributions are heavily tied to the pragmatism that he encountered studying under William James at Harvard. Like other
pragmatists, Du Bois is concerned with the practical implications of his theorizing
and, like those pragmatists who came before him, Du Bois is interested in
experience.212 The inward turn that pragmatists inherited from the idealists focused on the idea that our picture of reality was constructed by the mind and judged in
accordance with how well this map helped us navigate the world. Where James had
focused on religious experience in particular, and the role faith could play in, for
 
212 Later pragmatists, like John Dewey will also focus on the role of experience. In this case, Dewey grounds his philosophy of art in ‘aesthetic experience’. More can be read about Dewey and his account of aesthetic experience in the next section of this chapter.   
 
575 instance, helping a climber jump across a ravine, Du Bois was interested in examining
the experience of black Americans in a way that would advance their causes and
interests. This is seen acutely in Du Bois’s The Souls of Black Folks, where he sets out
his theory of double consciousness. Recall that the idealist tradition emerged out of the project of early modern rationalists like Descartes. Descartes had argued, in
contrast to Hume, that we have a unified and persistent self which we can have
perfect knowledge of through self-consciousness. In Du Bois’s account, this is a
luxury afforded to people who occupied Descartes’ position within society. In
particular, Du Bois argued that the experience of black Americans was inherently dual. Instead of directly perceiving a unified self, black Americans can only perceive
themselves through the eyes of others, and the picture that this reveals is one of a self
divided; two selves in conflict with one another, an American self and a black self.
The pragmatic goal of self-understanding is consciousness raising. Recall that Du Bois studied in Germany in a department which was, at the time, dominated by
Hegel. Hegel’s dialectic, in which we assist geist in continuously improving its self-
understanding by bringing together a thesis and antithesis until reaching a point of
absolute truth and freedom, seems to be at work here. The goal of black self-understanding, for Du Bois, is unifying the thesis and antithesis of an American
spirit and a black spirit in a way that comes to something truer and freer. However,
unlike the pragmatists that came before him, Du Bois is not as limited to using the
way the world is to judge our beliefs. For someone like Pierce, we are constantly running up against all kinds of constraints (like the beliefs of others) which cause us
to call our own beliefs into question. In this way, the world puts limits on our
consciousness.213 Meanwhile, Du Bois more clearly recognizes that our
consciousness can also affect our environment and therefore change the limits it places on us. We not only adapt our beliefs to the way the world constrains them,
but we can use our consciousness to change where, how, and why, the world does
constrain us. The role of his theory of double consciousness is not just to help black
Americans navigate the racist world that they inhabit, but to play a practical role in
 
213 Notice the ways in which Du Bois’ focus on the limits of consciousness resembles Fichte’s account of the absolute subject-object. 
 
576 eradicating racism altogether so as to allow the double consciousness to move
towards greater truth and freedom.214 
 
Within aesthetics and philosophy of art, Du Bois’s primary rivalry is with
Alain LeRoy Locke, a fellow Harvard alumnus and student of James. Locke was
born in Philadelphia nineteen years after the birth of Du Bois. After graduating from Harvard with degrees in English and philosophy, he became the first black American
to be selected as a Rhodes Scholar, and to continue his studies at Oxford University.
While many of the school’s colleges refused to accept Locke, he did eventually begin
his education, focusing in literature, classics, and philosophy through Hertford College. He also used his time in Europe to, like Do Bois, study at the Humboldt
University of Berlin. Locke completed his Ph.D. in philosophy at Harvard while
teaching at the historically black Howard University. He enjoyed a long and
influential career at Howard, with his ashes even eventually being kept on the campus during the 1990’s and early 2000’s. While Locke wrote on a number of
issues in value theory, black life in America, and his Bahá’i faith, his work on black
art and aesthetics remains his primary legacy. Locke is credited with drawing
intellectual popular American attention to the Harlem Renaissance.215 This was an enormous and varied aesthetic, intellectual, and artistic movement which emerged out of the community of black artists and thinkers in Harlem and sustained itself
from the late 1910’s to the early 1930’s. While any attempt to define the movement
would be inherently reductive of its many developments, works that emerged out of the movement tend to be characterized by a sense of overt racial pride, a focus on
both the lingering and ongoing effects of institutionalized racism in America, and
the sense that art could be used to advance the cause of racial justice.
 
214 Du Bois’s concept of false consciousness would later inspire James Baldwin’s related idea of ‘twoness’, which Baldwin takes to describe two competing strivings, rather than two consciousnesses. However, the exact relationship between the two concepts remains a subject of scholarly debate. 
215 The close relationship between black pragmatism, as a philosophical tradition, and the Harlem Renaissance, as an artistic movement seems to reflect the close relationship between German idealism and German romanticism, which serve as intellectual influences for pragmatism generally.   
 
577
On the face of it, the goal of using art for progressive social causes should be
perfectly in keeping with Du Bois’s pragmatism. If we can judge beliefs based on
their utility in helping us navigate the world, then we can also judge art in the same
way. Indeed, Du Bois and Locke were both incredibly supportive of the Harlem Renaissance movement and its artists, and Du Bois’s support was largely along
pragmatic lines. Du Bois begins by claiming that all art is inherently propaganda; it
advances one cause or another. However, following Hegel’s bringing together of the
good, true, and beautiful, Du Bois thinks that the presence of beauty will point
towards truth. The power of the Harlem Renaissance, for Du Bois, was that it represented a movement away from simpler, more moralistic attempts at racial
propaganda. Du Bois argues that black artists were often expected to present an
idealized form of black life, shying away from depictions that might play into
harmful racial stereotypes. This situation puts black artists in a bind between providing white audiences with the negative stereotypes that they expect and
producing seemingly helpful but unrelatable depictions of black lives which the
artists hoped would prevent prejudice from white audiences. While he often
personally hoped that artists would focus their attention on the honorable and upstanding lives of regular black folks, Du Bois thought that making beautiful art in
any form was the best way to advance the cause of black people everywhere, and in
this case, beauty meant beauty in a universal and humanistic sort of way. Black art
ought to force white audiences to respect black artists and, by extension, black people by satisfying the same, often disinterested, standards for beauty that white
artists aim to meet. In contrast to this, Locke argued that black art should focus on
self-expression and not white standards of beauty. The self-understanding that
comes with self-expression would, in his view, lead to a greater sense of self-determination. The goal, for Locke, is to bypass white aesthetics altogether, and for
black audiences and artists to take ownership of their artistic practices, expressing
their own points of view and judging their works by their own standards. This effort
represents the development of a distinct black aesthetics.216
 
216 Black aesthetics remains a thriving part of philosophy, with major figures like Fred Moten arguing that the centrality of improvisation in black performance arts reflects a sense in which improvisation is required throughout everyday black experience. Meanwhile, Paul C.

John Dewey 
 
If Pierce was concerned to begin his investigation by examining the
conscious experience of doubt, James was concerned with the conscious experience
of religious belief, and Du Bois interrogated the conscious experience of racial
marginalization, our next philosopher can be said to have been concerned with the
conscious experience of art. This philosopher, John Dewey, is also among the most famous and prolific American public intellectuals of the twentieth century. Dewey
was born into a modest family in Burlington, Vermont and began attending the
University of Vermont at the early age of fifteen. He then worked as a high school
teacher in Pennsylvania for a two-year period until some positive feedback on an essay he wrote on Hegel motivated him to enroll at Johns Hopkins University in
pursuit of a philosophy Ph.D. While at Johns Hopkins, Dewey studied under
Charles Sanders Peirce, and the experimental psychologist G. Stanley Hall, but also
under one of the department’s Hegel scholars. These three influences, pragmatism, German idealism, and the emerging science of psychology, would all prove to have a
profound impact on his own intellectual work. Upon finishing his degree at Johns
Hopkins, Dewey took up employment at both Michigan University and then the
newly founded University of Chicago, where he slowly moved away from a purer form of German idealism to a view more rooted in the experimental method. This
eventually led him to Columbia University where he would eventually serve as both
the president of the American Philosophical Association and the American
Psychological Association. He also became increasingly interested in education, writing two major works on philosophy of education which would later encourage
the development of a number of progressive ‘Deweyite’ schools. This support for
social liberalism, progressive political causes, and educational reform eventually took
Dewey to China, where he encouraged the then growing May Fourth Movement
(made up primarily of students dedicated to anti-imperialism) and advocated for
 
Taylor, operating within the pragmatist tradition discussed here, argues that black aesthetics is and should be a project of interrogating the ways in which art and aesthetic considerations establish and perpetuate black experience. The larger project of black pragmatism also remains visible in the work of Cornel West, who has argued that pragmatism emphasis on fixing belief between different people in a way that is practical and productive provides us with a model for American democracy. 
 
579
China to avoid following in the footsteps of the U.S. educational system by taking a
more pragmatic approach to developing their own system.217 However, even after
two years in the country, and around 200 well-attended public lectures, the
Confucian influence over Chinese education remained strong, and would keep a tight grip on Chinese education until the equally unreceptive Maoist government
gained control. He continued to write on political and social affairs and lecture
around the world until he died at home in New York City at the age of 92.
 
In order to understand Dewey’s pragmatism, we must first understand the
problem he hopes it to solve. Reflect back to where the greater Mediterranean philosophical tradition started, with Thales, Plato, Aristotle, and the like. We might
notice something shared in common by all these figures. In this case, philosophy
seems to have emerged in a Greece divided between the haves and the have-nots, and
while there have certainly been some figures of modest means, the story of philosophy’s founding in the region is primarily one about the most elite members of
their society. While the lower classes worked with their hands as slaves, farmers, and
artisans, those well off enough to live the life of the mind did not. Indeed, Socrates
reveals something of his status in declaring that it is the unexamined life that is not worth living. This now famous statement casts the philosopher’s role as one of
examining, not working. This would, of course, only seem natural to the wealthy
class of Athens who could afford to spend their time admiring the finest art and
savoring the most delicate treats. Where the poor engage with the world actively, the rich primarily engage with it as a subject examining an object.
 
Dewey’s claim is that because the earliest Greek thinkers were of the
aristocracy, they have inherited, without always realizing it, a rarified point of view.
In doing so, they began a tradition in which whatever was low-class was eschewed.
The poor are many, they deal in what is natural and material. The wealthy are few and deal in the refined and rational. The workers engage in practice and the elite
engage in theorizing. The history of philosophy, for Dewey, is a reflection of a
particular experience. The rich have attempted to mark themselves off from the rest,
 
217 Hu Shih, one of Dewey’s students at Columbia, played a major role in Dewey’s Chinese lecture series. Shih was also a notable philosopher in his own right, especially in the realm of Deweyan philosophy of education. 
 
580 and this attempt to draw distinctions cuts straight through the middle of philosophy
down to Dewey’s time. Dualities of this kind, between the mental, rational, and
theoretical on the one hand, and the material, natural, and practical on the other,
reflect the subject/object divide that examiners take to their art.
 
Nowhere is the phenomenon Dewey is describing clearer than in the work of Plato. Plato argued that the appetitive soul is to be dominated just as the laboring
parts of society should be. These ignorant cave-dwelling rabble dirty their hands with
work and the sweat of their brow instead of examining the sky with the starry skies as
their object. It should be no surprise then that Plato uses the subject/object mode and finds goodness in the exact opposite of the common people. He not only prizes
what is typical for those of his station, he can’t imagine a world in which the divide
that separates him from the workers doesn’t exist at all. Of course, this class divide is
only natural, because Plato takes the spheres of life that the two classes inhabit to be fundamentally and metaphysically distinct. Plato’s theory, with its lower realm and
realm of the forms draws the class lines across all of reality. In turn, by carving the
two worlds off from each other as he did, Plato separates the mental and the rational
from the material and productive. If there is a genuine divide between theory and practice, then philosophy must, by definition, stay an impractical pursuit. Dewey
argues that this entire divide, with all of its dualities, is an illusion only made possible
by philosophy remaining in the hands of the wealthy. From here, we can now work
backwards towards a less ideological picture of what philosophy could be. From a stance concerned with the practical experience of the working class, the
subject/object mode and its dualities fall away. Dewey, like the other pragmatists, is
heavily influenced by Darwin, and Darwin’s theory of natural selection has given
him a new model to replace the subject/object mode with. Instead, we should begin
philosophy from the perspective of an organism in an environment. Nowhere is this model put to better use by Dewey than in his philosophy of art.
 
Just as the rich imported the subject/object mode into philosophy, they also
carried it into the artworld. Our current way of thinking about art is driven by the
form of engagement we find at museums, in which disparate pieces of clothing, religious iconography, pottery, and so on are brought together into a
decontextualized and barren white space. Dewey traces the emergence of museums
out of the rise of colonialist nationalism in Europe. Monarchs conquering the
 
581 peoples of Africa and the Americas developed these museums to function as ongoing
Roman triumphs, the tradition in which victorious armies returned to Rome to
parade their exotic plunders through the streets. This was a bald expression of
Roman power. See for yourself how long the tip of Rome’s spear can reach, as its generals return with captives of very different cultures dressed in strange ways and
carrying their surrendered treasures on their backs. In Dewey’s account, this is
precisely the function of European museums. The chauvinism of Britain, France,
and Germany led them to gather their plunder together into massive hoards in their
capital cities. There, together with the finest homegrown artworks they could muster, they showed their wealth and power off to one another in an attempt to puff
their own national egos up at their neighbor’s expense. This focus on showing off
introduced an admiring and examining mode of engagement. Spectators visit
museums in order to engage in disinterested appreciation of a work’s value. Again, we find a divide between a passive subject and an inert object. This trend was only
exacerbated with the emergence of a capitalist class. Now, individual wealthy
collectors and rich families have built up their own galleries to serve as monuments
to their own individual greatness. Yet, perhaps there is a more ecological mode of engagement that we can find.
 
If we look back to the time before these kinds of artifacts were put into
museums, we find that most of them were involved in different kinds of ceremonies
and practices. Michelangelo’s statue David looks anatomically realistic with the exception of his hands, which are much larger. This is because David was originally
planned to sit atop the Florence Cathedral, and the smaller parts of his body needed
to be easily visible from far below. Similar stories, Dewey argues, can be told for all of
the pottery and clothing we find; they used to be utilized within an everyday
practice, and often one of some cultural or religious significance. The European tradition of painting itself was primarily done directly on church walls to heighten
religious experience within a church and was only moved on to canvases when
paintings became a portable consumer good for galleries, collections, and museums.
Notice that this earlier way of using art is exactly that, a way of using it. Art was not valuable in and of itself but because it served as a tool to facilitate a special kind of
experience that Dewey calls aesthetic experience.
 
582
On Dewey’s account, aesthetic experiences are active and ecological.
Everyday banal experiences lack boundaries: one thing simply happens and then
another until we fall asleep. What aesthetic experiences give us is a sense of
completion; they take regularly experienced features of the world and intensify them continuously until we arrive at a sense of satisfaction. A meal takes disparate
elements from different ingredients and dishes and synthesizes them together in a
way that builds towards a moment of satiation. Narrative works like books and
movies do the same thing, weaving together characters and events into a plot with a
resolution. This sense of culmination is what separates aesthetic experience from the humdrum of the everyday. The aesthetic carves off a particular moment as distinct
from others and thereby renders it rewarding in a certain sense. While art is especially
good at giving us these kinds of experiences, they are not exclusive to it. We can also
get them from working on a project, from meals with friends, and from a long hike among many other things. The problem is that the subject/object mode of
engagement that we find at museums is not conducive to genuine aesthetic
experiences. According to Dewey, a proper philosophy of art will enable us to
maintain relationships with art objects and with other people through those objects. When we take a statue out of its ceremonial function in a religious aesthetic
experience and bring it into the gallery, it is rendered inert, and our engagement is
accordingly passive.
 
Jane Addams 
 
Another Dewey associate stands out in this generation of pragmatists,
however, unlike the others, she was not a student of his. Jane Addams was born in
Cedarville, Illinois and was the last child born into a large wealthy family. Her father
was an Illinois State Senator, a friend and supporter of Abraham Lincoln throughout his Illinois and national political career, and was, himself, a founding
member of the Republican Party. Her mother died in childbirth when Addams was
only two, leaving her and her seven siblings to be raised, in part, by the eldest
amongst them. However, before she was even a teenager, four of these brothers and sisters had passed away. Her own health faced serious challenges when, at four, she
 
583 was diagnosed with tuberculosis of the spine. The result of this infection was that she
suffered from a curvature of the spine which cut into her ability to engage in many
physical activities, and which caused a number of health complications throughout
her life. She desired to work as a doctor in order to serve the poor, a dream she developed after reading the work of Charles Dickens, and she attended the Rockford
Female Seminary in pursuit of that. While there, she excelled academically, serving as
the school’s valedictorian and the editor of the college’s student newspaper.
 
While Addams entered her college education with the intention of
becoming a medical doctor, this plan did not survive her time at Rockford Female Seminary. Her father’s death while she was in graduate school had a profound
impact on the young Addams, and she would spend the next ten years feeling lost.
Between bouts of health issues, Addams traveled frequently to Europe. Then, on one
of such trips, she had an experience that would change the course of her life. In London, Addams visited Toynbee Hall, a Christian ‘social settlement’ project. It
provided housing and work opportunities for young, impoverished men. Addams
was so transformed by this encounter that she returned to the United States set on
creating an American equivalent and opened Hull House in Chicago. Hull House primarily served Chicago’s large and growing immigrant population at the time. In
addition to providing housing and services to those in need, it also became a place for
other social reformers to meet to discuss and plan other social welfare programs.
Because it was not committed to a particular ideology, such as Christianity or Utilitarianism, Hull House was seen as a flexible and open-ended place which simply
responded to community needs rather than imposing a particular image of progress
or of help onto its environment. It created the first ‘little theatre’ and ‘juvenile court
in America, and also opened the first public kitchen, playground, swimming pool,
and gym in Chicago. It also served as a staging area for union organizing and for work campaigning for a number of progressive laws. Further, while it did follow
Toynbee Hall in serving only men, unlike Toynbee Hall, Hull House was led
entirely by women. Its progressive leadership included a number of unmarried
women and women in romantic relationships with other women (and, by most modern historical estimations, Addams herself was in the latter group).
 
As Addams reputation grew in Chicago, she soon became immersed in
larger progressive causes. She was a founding member of the American Civil
 
584
Liberties Union, the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, and the
NAACP. She was even asked by Teddy Roosevelt to second his nomination for the
Progressive Party Presidential ticket. This high profile put her into contact with John
Dewey, who had moved to the city to work at the University of Chicago. The two would have a lifelong intellectual friendship, which continued to be carried out by
correspondence when Dewey left the city. Yet, while her work with the Hull House
made her a national progressive icon, her work was not without controversy. When
World War I broke out, Addams became, perhaps, one of the country’s most active
voices against the war and for the cause of pacificism. This work led to her social isolation in a wartime America that had little interest in her pacificism, and their
public comments against her were often heavily colored by the misogyny of her
critics. Indeed, while they remained friends, Addams was even pushed to engage in a
public dispute with Dewey over the issue. However, despite this decline in her influence and popularity, Addams was still awarded with the Nobel Peace Prize in
1931 for work advocating for pacificism.
 
In terms of Addams’ philosophical contributions, she is, of course, highly
pragmatic. We can see this in the way that she ran Hull House, which was a bottom-up enterprise, whose work didn’t begin with theorizing and then hope for some ‘cash
value’ for those beliefs. Instead, she let the evidence of effectiveness lead her towards
a better understanding. Like Dewey and the Utilitarians that pragmatists often draw
on, Addams thought education was central to social progress. However, instead of this simply being a flow of information from an instructor to students, Addams
thought that ‘sympathetic knowledge’ was generated in people when they had
opportunities to work and interact with other people with other perspectives. If we
want to, for instance, understand domestic work, we can talk to domestic workers
and listen to their experiences. Rather than beginning, as many philosophers would, with a bit of abstract theorizing about the nature of work and domestic life, Addams
recommends listening widely to the marginalized voices who participate in domestic
work and seeing in what ways our understanding of it doesn’t work for them. This
idea, that people in different social positions have access to knowledge that others
don’t, can be called standpoint epistemology, and it remains a major part of feminist philosophy to this day. For Addams, the fact that different people have
 
585 different standpoints, and therefore, different knowledge, means that philosophy
should be pluralistic and non-hierarchical (just as Hull House was).
 
Beyond her epistemology, Addams developed, as we might expect, a
nuanced social philosophy.218 While most of the pragmatists, like their American
transcendentalist predecessors, saw social progress as a good to work towards, Addams’ worked to explain how we could guarantee that this social progress was
egalitarian. According to a standard pragmatist example, we can answer the question
of how we know that our science is more justified than that of Medieval Europe by
pointing to the fact that the modern United States can send people to the moon and treat cancer in a way that the Carolingian Empire could not. This progress, the
difference in the cash value of our beliefs and theirs’, justifies our method of science
over their method of authority. However, it isn’t exactly true that, for any one of us,
we can say that we can go to the moon in a way that a Visigothic peasant could not. After all, many of these great leaps in progress are exclusive. The fact is that only
some people in our society can afford to have their cancer treated with the best
possible treatments. For this reason, Addams suggests that social progress can only be
measured by looking at the gains which are held in common by all within a society. Instead of pointing to the cash value of our beliefs as they are experienced or
embodied in the most exemplary people in our society, we should measure ourselves
by the ‘lateral progress’ experienced by everyone. In this way, even our charitable
works don’t represent full or actual social progress, as giving charitably is still something that separates the donor from the recipient. The goal, then, should not be
to expand charitable efforts (which are good as a stop gap), but to reconstruct our
society so that all people have an equal footing in economic production.
 
218 Another important theorist instrumental in the development of sociology, and one as interested in questions of race, gender, and class, is the British philosopher Harriet Martineau. Martineau was deeply influenced by Auguste Comte and was an English-language translator of his work. She was a defender of the laissez-faire economic theory and argued that religions develop according to the demands of their environments, with modern religions becoming more abstract as society progress. Ultimately, she argued, this would inevitably lead to atheism, which she saw as the true and logical conclusion of this process.   
 
586
Ida B. Wells 
 
While we have not directly addressed it, we have already seen some very close
ties between American pragmatism, and its utilitarian and transcendentalist
influences, and the work of investigative journalists. For instance, the
transcendentalist philosopher Margaret Fuller has historically primarily been
described as journalist, rather than a philosopher, while both the utilitarian Annie Besant and the pragmatist W.E.B. Du Bois served as magazine editors (for Our 
Corner and The Crisis respectively). It is in this tradition that we find the work of
Ida B. Wells. Wells was born into slavery in Holly Springs, Mississippi during the
American Civil War. During Reconstruction, her father opened his own carpentry business and was active in Republican politics. He also served as a trustee of Shaw
College (which was later renamed Rust College). When Wells was sixteen, while
visiting her grandmother’s nearby farm, a yellow fever epidemic took the lives of
both of her parents and of a brother. Her surviving relatives decided that it would be best, under the circumstances, to split her and her six siblings up to live in separate
foster families. However, she resisted this plan and instead began working as a
teacher in order to provide for them and keep them under the same roof. During this
time, she also attended Shaw College for a two-year period before a conflict with the school’s president led to her expulsion. Details of what exactly caused her expulsion
are hard to pinpoint exactly, as she found the ordeal to be too painful to speak about.
The best historical indications suggest that the devout then-President of the college,
W.W. Hooper, had objected to something that Wells had done (possibly for reasons of perceived impropriety) and that she insisted on defending herself rather than back
down. With Shaw College out of the picture, and with her two brothers of age to
begin apprenticing as carpenters, Wells moved her and her sisters to Memphis,
Tennessee to work as a teacher. She continued to take classes there at both Fisk
University and Lemoyne-Owen College.
 
It was in Memphis that Wells’ activism began in full. She garnered a
reputation for being outspoken on issues of racial justice and women’s rights. This
reputation only grew when, in 1884, she refused to move from her first-class seat in
the ‘ladies’ car’ to the smoking car in order to make room for white passengers. The conductor of the train, along with two other men, dragged her from her seat and out
 
587 of the car. The incident became a local news story and Wells hired an attorney to sue
the railroad. While she initially won her case, the Tennessee Supreme Court reversed
the ruling. Wells soon after took up a second job as a journalist for the Memphis-
based Evening Star, writing columns criticizing Jim Crow laws under a pseudonym. This work, in particular on documenting the state of Black schools in Tennessee, led
to her being removed from her teaching position. Wells, being undeterred, doubled
her journalistic efforts, reporting on a number of lynchings across the South.
Eventually, when this work drew the ire of the local white population, she became
the subject of a number of particularly gruesome public threats against her safety and attacks began on the office of her publisher. This led to Wells moving to Harlem,
never to return to Memphis again.
 
Working out of Harlem, Wells continued to cover lynchings across
America, and to analyze patterns which emerged across the data she gathered, writing two books on the motivations of lynchings and political remedies. Wells also began a
series of speaking tours across Britian and served as the first black woman to work as
a paid correspondent for a mainstream white newspaper. The international attention
that she got on this tour resulted in a larger national profile at home and resumed criticism of her activism (now coming from publications like the New York Times).
While she maintained the public (and sometimes financial) support of then-aging
civil rights activist Frederick Douglass and was actively involved as a founding
member of the NAACP, her radical approach to racial justice issues also drew critics from within the community. In her own estimation, she was left off the list of
founding members of the NAACP by W.E.B. Du Bois intentionally because of these
differences.
 
Wells eventually ended up in Chicago, where she married a prominent
attorney and civil rights activist and continued her own work. When Chicago began considering adopting a scheme of racial segregation in schools, Wells drew on her
own experience teaching in segregated schools in the South in her scathing criticisms
of the suggestion. She formed a community of activists with the help of Jane
Addams and the group was successful in ending discussions of school segregation in the city. She also ran for a seat in the Illinois State Senate, was instrumental in the
establishment of the first black settlement house in Chicago (operating as an
equivalent to the Hull House), and fought tirelessly for the cause of women’s
 
588 suffrage (while at the same time publicly criticizing many of the movement’s white
leaders for their complicity in widespread systems of racial oppression).
 
We can get at much of Wells’ philosophy by examining a public exchange
between her and fellow pragmatist (and sometime collaborator) Jane Addams.
Addams, in her article “Respect for Law” argues against lynching in ways we might expect of a pragmatist, especially given their utilitarian influences. She addresses
herself to southern whites and argues that violence is an ineffective means of
achieving social order. Violence, she tells us, begats violence. While many of these
lynchings were said to be efforts to protect white women from black men, Addams argues that retributivism had been shown throughout history to be little more than a
tool for the powerful of a society to express their disdain for the oppressed. She also
argues, from a feminist perspective, that claims about protecting women, in fact, do
the opposite. Rather than being liberated from their supposed attacker, violent defenses of women reinforce a social order in which women are seen as the
possessions of men and which the possessive man is cast as the true victim, in having
faced an affront to his property. These arguments make a great deal of sense coming
from Addams, as they are in line with her pragmatism and her feminism, but also with her pacifism.
 
By contrast, Wells’ views about the uses of violence and its causes differed
wildly from Addams’ pacifist tendencies. First, Wells complains that Addams accepts
the initial premise of these attacks, that there was something to retaliate against.
Wells outlines some of the data that she had gathered on the many cases across the country and argues that there is no factual basis for claims that white women were
victims of black male aggression. Instead, the best explanation for why these events
happen is the perceived sense of threat that white populations feel towards black
economic advancement. Lynchings are not, even from the perspectives of those who undertake them, about protecting white women or children, they are about
enforcing an economic order in which white people are and will continue to be
above black people. This can be seen in one of the early cases that Wells reported on,
the ‘People’s Grocery lynchings’. In this case, a white grocery store owner used the pretext of the ‘danger’ of black men to incite a mob to attack a rival black-owned
grocery store. A shootout began when those inside the black-owned grocery store
attempted to defend themselves and three black men were subsequently arrested.
 
589
While awaiting trial, and presumably with a degree of institutional collaboration, a
large group of 75 men, dressed in masks, entered the jail and took the three men from
their cells and murdered them at a railyard outside the city. While the claimed
motivation for this entire incident was the white store owner witnessing a fight between two boys, the ‘cash value’ of this story was that his largest competitor was
murdered. A similar pattern, Wells tells us, can be seen across the vast majority of
lynching cases. If we, as pragmatists, are to focus on the cash value of our beliefs in
determining their meanings, then perhaps we should do the same in determining the
meanings of our actions. In this way, Addams fell short of her goal of sympathetic knowledge, as she, by her own estimation, has no first-hand experience with racial
violence.
 
With this picture in mind, Wells concludes that efforts to engage in a good
faith dialogue on issues of women’s safety is to miss the point entirely. Indeed, the cash value of this debate is, itself, the protection of the system of racial oppression.
The effect of it is that less attention and effort is put on addressing the actual root
causes of these murders. Without the ability to change the entire economic order to
the point where Addams’ goal of an egalitarian, lateral form of social progress is possible, black Americans cannot count on the cash value of a good faith debate.
Instead, Wells argues, against Addams’ pacificist approach, that armed self-defense is

The 
 
Phenomenologists 
 
Where we last left the Continental tradition, it was in a period of
diversification. Whereas the 18th century had followed the 17th and 16th before it in a
complete commitment to rationalism (and the idealism that it arrived at), Schopenhauer, Marx, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche all give radically different answers
to what they find in Hegel. While Schopenhauer, in many ways, continued on the
tradition of idealism that he inherits from Hegel, he draws much more pessimistic
conclusions about reality and our place in it. Meanwhile, Marx had inverted idealism into his new dialectical materialism. While the resulting picture differs in many ways
from that offered by Nietzsche, both theorists cast our ideas as historically
contingent. Of course, Hegel did as well, but his optimism allowed for us to at least
conclude that, if we cannot have certain and perfect knowledge in the present, our ideas are still the most advanced form of consciousness ever to grace the earth. By
contrast, the materialism of Marx and Nietzsche raise doubts about our ability to
reason our way into genuine universal knowledge. Even Kierkegaard, with his return
to the religious sphere, offers us a highly individualized picture. It is, after all, up to
each of us to step beyond reason and to take a leap of faith. The result of all of this is that Continental philosophy in the 19th century was highly individualized,
materialistic, relativist, skeptical, having long since abandoned the high aspirations of
people like Plato and Descartes, of providing us with absolute and universal certain
knowledge.
 
Another, divergent, thread of influence can be found in the German
romanticist movement. As we have already mentioned, German romanticism sought
 
593 to break from the neoclassicism of Enlightenment thinkers like Hegel, who looked to
the classical period of Greek philosophy as their guiding light. These thinkers valued
the rationality, open dialogue, and democratic ideals of Athenian civic life, and this
was reflected in their epistemology, their political philosophy, and their art. By contrast, the romantics were skeptical of the industrialization and urban
development that the Enlightenment era brought to the world. Instead, the
romantics invite us to look to the natural, the wild and unruly, and the private. One’s
individual subjective experience, their emotional life, and rootedness in an
environment were all seen as important, if not more, for living a human life than our capacity for reason and industrial development. If any society could be seen as living
most in sync with the human experience, for the romantics, it was Medieval Europe.
German romantic art is often characterized by depictions of nature at its wildest,
knights, and courtly romance. While we had encountered German romanticism in talking about the German idealists and Nietzsche, the majority of the movement’s
impact has so far been seen in aesthetic theorizing and on refocusing on nature. The
interest in medievalism would not reach its high point in Germany until the 20th
century. Here, we find this influence somehow preserved in a kind of unstable equilibrium alongside the refocusing on the quest for universal human knowledge
described above. As is often the case, these wildly different forces combine in
Germany in the 20th century to produce something wholly original and interesting.
 
It is against this backdrop that phenomenology emerges, in the 20th century, as a movement seeking to reconstruct and return to a much older
philosophical method. Taken literally, phenomenology is the study of the
phenomena, those ghostly apparitions described by Kant which represent the
noumenal world of external objects in our mind. The phenomena, you will
remember, are the way things appear to us in perception. Recall that, on Kant’s picture, we cannot have any real knowledge of the noumena, but we can have
knowledge of the phenomena. Of course, Kant wasn’t the only person pushing a line
like this. Descartes himself sought perfect knowledge in conscious experience. While
we can doubt, on his view, whether we have a physical body or that we are in the place we think we are (facts about the noumenal realm), we can be certain of our
own thoughts in the mental realm. This is the characteristic feature that draws 20th
century phenomenologists into the business of studying the phenomena, the hope of
 
594 certain and universal knowledge, even if it is limited to the internal human
experience. In this way, we can think of phenomenology as the investigation,
categorization, and description of the features of human consciousness, of what it (in
the broadest possible sense) is like for us (in the broadest possible sense).
 
The reasons for this turn away from materiality are many and varied, depending on the philosopher in question. Perhaps it reflects a larger concern about
modernity and the crisis of meaning which it brought on. Without a unifying certain
picture of the world and our place in it, the bonds of social cohesion seemed to have
been unwinding. Two world wars kick off a bloody century of industrial growth and destabilization. The seeds of a philosophical response to this predicament were, at
that point, already sewn by the German philosopher Franz Brentano, when he
argued that the fundamental characteristic of our mental life is the fact that our ideas
are about things. While this may seem like a trivial idea, its implications are quite profound. Imagine spending the day rearranging large rocks on the beach until,
when viewed from above, they resemble the face of Academy Award winning actor
Robert DeNiro. When your friend asks you what the image is of, you can say that it
is of Robert DeNiro. If we thought of it as a work of art, we could say that it is ‘about Robert DeNiro’. Now imagine that a powerful hurricane had, instead, swept
across the same beach, and the resulting winds and storm surge had rearranged the
same rocks in the same configuration, so that it resembled Academy Award winning
actor Robert DeNiro. Is this still of him? Is it about him? We would likely say not, it merely happens to look like him. In order for it to be about him, it takes the ‘mark of






the mental’. We can call this unique mental property (of aboutness)
‘intentionality’. Notice something strange about intentionality though, it cannot,
on Brentano’s account, come about through a mere natural process, as it requires the
intervention of the mental. However, modern psychologists tell us that the mental is, itself, brought about through natural processes in the brain. This seems to raise the
question of whether, and how, intentionality emerges in the mind in the way that it
does. Two of Brentano’s students will draw similar conclusions about this situation
and push off in parallel directions.
 
First among these enterprising students is Sigmund Freud. Freud was
trained as a neurologist and, in his early writings, describes his commitment to the
idea that mental events can be reduced to physical events in the nervous system. In
 
595 many ways, this is an assumption of neuroscience and much of healthcare. The idea
is that complex phenomena can be totally explained in terms of less complex, more
basic phenomena. This view is called ‘reductionism’. We have seen the success of
the reductionist strategy throughout the history of science. For instance, if we want to understand a problem like strep throat, we can describe it in terms of the bacterial
genus streptococcus. Explaining its treatment, by penicillin, requires that we move to
an even lower level and to simpler bio-mechanisms. Penicillin contains a substance
known as ‘beta-lactam’. When introduced to the body, it inhibits the growth of
bacteria due differences between human and bacterial cell biology. How this happens has to do with chemical interactions around the cell wall of the bacteria, and
these interactions occur because of facts about electrons in the elements which make
those chemicals up. In this way, we have reduced a complex biological phenomenon,
like strep throat, into a chemical phenomenon at the level of our cells. In turn, we can reduce this chemical explanation to one in terms of physics, describing it in
terms of only things like protons, neutrons, and electrons. The hope of
reductionism, in the philosophy of mind, is to do the same for mental phenomena,
to move from the psychological, through the biological, to the chemical and, ultimately, to the physical. However, if Brentano is right about the mark of the
mental, this may not be possible. For this reason, Freud is drawn into disavowing the
reductionist project of his youth in favor of a psychoanalytic method which deals
with mental phenomena at the level of the mental (that is, in terms of what they are about). A similar skepticism about reductionism is supported by Brentano’s other
student, the founder of phenomenology. We can turn to his work now.
 
Edmund Husserl 
 
Edmund Husserl was born in the city of Prossnitz in the Austrian Empire
(in what is today the Czech Republic). His father was a hatmaker who sent him to be educated in Vienna and then in the Czech town of Olmütz. While he was
apparently, by his own estimation, a middling student (despite his love for
mathematics), he did go on to attend Leipzig University, where he studied
 
596 mathematics, philosophy, and physics. After a brief stint in graduate school in
Berlin, Husserl completed his doctorate at the University of Vienna (where he
studied under Franz Brentano), writing a dissertation in mathematical theory. In the
time after this, Husserl bounced between various academic positions in Berlin, Vienna, and Halle, before arriving at Göttingen. He also used this period to get
married, have three children, and begin writing works on the philosophy of
mathematics. For sixteen years, Husserl taught at Göttingen, developing his theory
of phenomenology before moving to Freiburg im Breisgau, where he would remain
until his retirement. Upon his retirement, Husserl remained an active scholar, traveling, lecturing, and writing until the racial laws passed by the Nazi Party barred
him from accessing any academic library under their rule due to his being Jewish.
Despite this, he continued to work feverishly, writing and lecturing, until he died at
the age of 79, as a result of an illness which came on after a bad fall.
 
As its name suggests, Husserl founds phenomenology as an attempt to study
phenomena (in Kant’s sense of the word). That is, phenomenology is the study of
appearances, or the way things seem to us from our first-person point of view. For
Husserl, phenomenology is the study of pure consciousness. This might strike the careful reader as akin to Kant’s transcendental idealism, in which we can only know
about phenomena and cannot know about the noumena towards which those
phenomenal appearances point. However, there are a few key differences between
Husserl’s proposal and Kant’s theory. First, Kant is committed to a metaphysical claim about the noumena. Namely, Kant is committed to the view that the noumena
exist, as this was the key difference between him and the German idealists that follow
him. While Kant endorses this metaphysical claim, he also endorses an
epistemological claim; that we can’t know about the nature of the noumena. Both of
these claims fall outside of the purview of Husserl’s phenomenology. Husserl’s concerns are less purely philosophical and are as much strategic. He sees himself as
founding a kind of science, and his role in this is to set out the disciplinary bounds. It
is not the view of geology as such, that we can only have knowledge of rocks. Instead,
geology simply carves out the study of rocks as its place in the domain of knowledge. The same is true for Husserl’s phenomenology. He does not argue that we can only
have knowledge of appearances, but that phenomenology merely represents an
attempt to get at knowledge of those appearances. In this way, where Kant provides a
 
597 kind of answer to questions about the noumena (that they exist and that we can’t
know their true nature), Husserl tells us to set these questions aside. As he tells us, we
should bracket all questions about the noumena and their existence.  In this way,
Husserl’s proposal more closely represents Descartes’ than Kant’s. Recall that Descartes’ radical skepticism was methodological rather than purely philosophical
the way that earlier skeptics were. This intentionally leaves open the question of the
existence of the noumena and whether we can have knowledge of them. Once we
have done this metaphysical bracketing, Husserl tells us that we are practicing the
epoché, or are fully cognitively engaged in the phenomenological method. It is his hope that this will make of philosophy a descriptive science of consciousness capable
of giving us genuine, perfect, and universal knowledge.
 
What, then, does Husserl’s science tell us? Despite his agnosticism about the
existence and knowability of the noumena, Husserl still sees the noumena as playing a kind of indirect role. Like Brentano (and Hume) before him, Husserl sees
intentionality as the mark of the mental. The phenomena, as they are presented in
pure conscious, have a kind of apparent directedness. That is, they always point
towards something they, on the face of it, purport to represent. When we have the perception of a dolphin, that mental object is unified and persists in time in a way
that suggests that there is such a dolphin (in a mind-independent way), even if
phenomenology cannot and should not assess the validity of that claim. Beyond this,
Husserl thinks that consciousness is always thetic. This is to say that when we are conscious of something, we are aware that we are conscious of it. This means that
consciousness is, for Husserl, always higher-order; we have the direct, first-order
perception which points at an existing object and, at the same time, an
accompanying awareness of our perception of that object and a corresponding belief
that we are having such a perception. This two-tiered structure is the fundamental and universal nature of conscious experience for Husserl, and we can know this
structure perfectly, because it deals only in appearances. While we could be wrong
about whether what appears to us to be an apple is actually an apple or is, in fact, a
peach (the problem of appearance and reality for noumenal objects), we can’t reasonably doubt whether it, in fact, appeared to be an apple to us in that moment.
That is, when it comes to appearances themselves, there is no appearance reality
distinction, the appearance is the reality of appearances. Thus, after bracketing off
 
598 metaphysical questions about the noumena, we can still make genuine and universal
ontological conclusions about the phenomena. Just as Hegel moved from
attempting to get certainty about our concepts themselves to attempting to get
certainty about the laws of thought which make it possible to have the concepts we have, Husserl’s strategy is to move from an attempt to get certainty about the objects
of thought, to one of attempting to get certainty about the conditions of
consciousness which enable the presentation of an object within our mind.
 
With all that being said, Husserl’s philosophy has left most of the scientific
work of phenomenology quite open. He has told us only the most basic and fundamental aspects of consciousness, and only discussed what all phenomena have
in common. In this way, by his own estimation, he, like Moses, has only led others to
the promise land. He looks upon a fertile field of inquiry, but he will not enter and
cultivate its fruits. Instead, he leaves that project to successive generations of students, who will each leave their mark on the discipline. These students will deny
large parts of Husserl’s picture, argue against him, radically change what it means to
do phenomenology, and draw interesting and dramatic conclusions from revised
iterations of his methodology.219
 
219 While the remainder of this chapter will focus on a number of Husserl’s students, and the students of those philosophers, another of his students is worth mentioning. Gerda Walther’s work centers, in part, on the nature of community from a phenomenological perspective. Walther takes up a question posed by Husserl. Husserl notices that a real community is bound together in spirit beyond merely being a collection of individuals. This binding must be accounted for in the subjective experience of community members and, therefore, is describable by phenomenology. Walther’s phenomenological account tells us that a community is constructed when individuals’ conscious experience is simultaneously directed toward one another and toward a shared object of attention. This brings together a number of individual subjective experiences into a unified communal experience. This account of community underlies Walther’s work as a communitarian political activist as well.

Edith Stein & Hedwig Conrad-Martius 
 
One of the early pioneering students of Husserl’s phenomenological
method was Edith Stein. She was the youngest of eleven children born into a well-to-do Jewish family in Breslau, Poland (now called Wroclaw). When her father died
while she was still a toddler, her mother took over the family lumberyard. Stein
herself attended school in Breslau and graduated at the top of her class. At this point she promptly began college and took up the study of psychology. This was her first
encounter with the work of Edmund Husserl, who she was so inspired by that she
moved to Göttingen to immerse herself in the phenomenological movement
forming around him. In Göttingen, she began discussing issues of philosophy with
many of Husserl’s disciples, joining the Munich and Göttingen circles, two philosophical scenes of likeminded philosophers and students of Husserl which
together form a kind of unified school. She also approached Husserl directly about
writing a doctoral dissertation in phenomenology under his supervision. He was initially resistant, but she eventually became his first paid assistant. However, this
work was short-lived, as Husserl refused to talk philosophy with her, much to her
frustration, even as she edited his manuscripts for publication (for which publishers
hardly acknowledged her role).  She was then denied the opportunity to be the first woman to complete a ‘Habilitation’ (a kind of second thesis after completing a
doctorate), with Husserl only writing a half-hearted letter of support.220 Without a
path forward in academia in Göttingen, she briefly returned to Breslau before
travelling to Bergzabern to stay with her close friend and fellow student of Husserl,
Hedwig Conrad-Martius.221 It was while staying in Bergzabern that she first read the
work of Theresa of Ávila and was instantly struck by it. She immediately converted
to Roman Catholicism and began studying the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas.
Inspired by Aquinas, Stein wrote a new Habilitation and returned to shopping the
work around to philosophers within Germany. While she received slightly more
 
220 While Stein would have been the first woman in Germany to complete a Habilitation, she was not the first German woman to earn a Ph.D., an honor which goes to a then seventeen-year-old Dorothea Schlöezer, a contemporary of Friedrich Schiller’s. 221 Conrad-Martius was also a philosopher in her own right and will be discussed later in this section.  
 
600 support for this effort, the opportunity for a teaching job in Münster took her away
from this project.
 
With the rise of the Nazi party in Germany, Stein’s Jewish descent led to her
being dismissed from her teaching position within two years of obtaining it. Without
employment, she joined a Carmelite convent and took the name of Teresa Benedicta of the Cross. She continued to write during this time, though these works focus on
religious themes, and she was transferred to Holland for her safety. She wrote a letter
to then Pope Pius XI, asking him to publicly denounce the Nazi party, but it
remained unanswered (though he did eventually do so four years later, but not by name). When Dutch bishops began to denounce the antisemitism of the Nazi
regime, German authorities retaliated by targeting non-Aryan Roman Catholics.
Stein, along with her sister (who had also converted), was arrested by the Gestapo
and taken to Auschwitz, where those who saw her testified that she spent her time there helping and serving others. She was later transferred to Birkenau concentration
camp, where she and her sister, along with many other Jewish people, were killed in
the gas chamber. She was later beatified and canonized, and she is one of six patron
saints of Europe.
 
As her biography has already shown us, Stein’s philosophical work can be
seen as an attempt to synthesize the phenomenological method of Husserl with
Aquinas’ metaphysics. Recall that Aquinas answered the problem of universals by
adopting a position, inspired by Aristotle, called ‘moderate realism’. On this view,
universal categories are immanent. This is to say that they are essences which exist in the individuals which make them up. So, two poodles may have separate existences,
which can begin and end at different times, and we can talk meaningfully about the
essential nature of poodles, but this essential nature only exists insofar as it is realized
in the individuals which participate in it. You can see how much this view represents Aristotle’s hylomorphic theory, in which forms are immanent in the same way. The
trouble, for Stein, comes in reconciling Aquinas’ realism about things in the world
with Husserl’s methodological agnosticism which requires that we bracket such
questions. Stein’s resolution to this is to adopt a position bringing in elements of Duns Scotus and Kant as well. Here, she employs Scotus’ concept of haecceity, or
the individual essence which makes the individual the distinct thing it is. Universal
essences exist, as Aquinas tells us, but on Stein’s picture, so do haecceities. We can see
 
601 the influence of Kant in the fact that we cannot know the universal essences, as they
are only potential and have no causal power in our world. Instead, we can only access
and have knowledge of individual haecceities. This mirrors Kant’s transcendental
idealism, in which we can only know the phenomena and not the noumena. However, our knowledge of these individual essences is achieved through the
phenomenological method. Thus, while she follows Husserl in method, her use of
Aquinas and Duns Scotus allows her to get to at least some form of essential
knowledge, that of haecceities or individual essences. This will give her the resources
to discuss a topic which she is particularly interested in, persons and their relationships with other persons.
 
In this case, Stein argues that careful reflection on our individual conscious,
bracketed, experience reveals that our lives are essentially characterized by our
valuing things. We value things and people around us, we recognize value in the world, and we require value to function. What we think is good and bad is tied up in
our haecceity; these things make us, as individuals, ourselves. Our valuing things is
the basis for our interaction with the world. We humans inhabit a unique position in
that we have one foot in the spirit world of goodness and mental activity, but the other in the material world. This allows us to realize ourselves and extend ourselves
into the world by acting in ways that promote or issue from our values. When we
bump into other creatures like ourselves, who generate and promote their own value,
we recognize this through our capacity for empathy. Thus, when we think about a question like the problem of other minds, in which we wonder whether and how we
might know that others have mental lives like our own, we can say that empathy
assumes it and that we can’t help but empathize with other people. This experience,
of empathy, is transcendent, because it allows us to get to that person’s individual
essence, which we can have knowledge of. In this way, the phenomenological method, seemingly tied up in the individualized methodology of Descartes, is
inherently social for Stein; a position she arrives at by bringing together the latest
philosophy of her day with the insights and tools of medieval philosophy.
 
Another influential member of the Munich and Göttingen circles was Edith
Stein’s close friend, Hedwig Conrad-Martius. Conrad-Martius hailed from Rostock, Germany, which sits on the northwestern coast along the Baltic Sea. She
was the daughter of a physician, and perhaps her father’s education led her parents to
 
602 support her own, as the family moved to Berlin when Conrad-Martius was fifteen,
on account of there being no girls’ schools in Northern Germany. After four years,
she graduated to the University of Rostock, where she studied philosophy and
became enamored with the work of Baruch Spinoza. She then spent some time in Munich, joining the Munich circle, before transferring to complete her doctorate
under Husserl in Göttingen. Over the next four years, Conrad-Martius became a
central figure of the emerging Göttingen circle as well, studying under Husserl and
others. However, the members of the Munich and Göttingen circles began to grow
disillusioned with Husserl’s later work, and his attempt to move from a descriptive science of conscious experience to a transcendental exploration of the laws of
consciousness. This was especially true for those, like Conrad-Martius, who had
followed him to Göttingen from Munich, who wanted to get at the essences of the
objects of consciousness, not the conditions which make it possible. Between this and administrative hurdles around the submission of her dissertation, she returned
to Munich and quickly submitted her work, thereby earning her doctorate. Conrad-
Martius, now with Ph.D. in hand and recently married, moved to Bergzabern.
Holdovers from the Munich and Göttingen circles began to assemble there, along with some younger students, and they continued engaging in a project of righting
Husserl’s legacy, even if that meant correcting the man himself and the students who
followed him toward the transcendent. Before her death at the age of 77, she took up
work teaching at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and set about writing her magnum opus, a book entitled Metaphysik des Irdischen, or Metaphysics 
of the Earthly.
 
Like Stein, Conrad-Martius is influenced deeply by both Husserl and
scholasticism. In true scholastic fashion, she, in many ways, returns to Aristotle.
Aristotle had laid out a hierarchy of souls in which different classes of creatures survive with merely the nutritive capacity, while others also have the perceptible
soul. Further still, there are creatures higher up the hierarchy which have locomotive
souls in addition to these. Finally, it is only humans that have the rational soul, which
provides us with our final cause. That is, because we are, by our essence, rational animals, Aristotle thinks that what it means to live and good life and flourish is to
exercise that capacity. This ‘great chain of being’ was adopted as the predominant
view of life from Aristotle’s time through until the scientific revolution. We can see
 
603 it in the theory of emanations popular from the time of al-Fārābī in the Islamic
golden age through to that of Hildegard of Bingen in Medieval Europe. Conrad-
Martius, in effect, is a defender of a hierarchical model like this, which places
humans in a unique position. However, her claim is that it is our will which places us above the other creatures. We stand out because we can choose to pursue things
beyond our drives and genetic programming, and this is what makes us human. This
has some important implications. Recall that Edith Stein wanted, like many in the
Munich and Göttingen circles, to preserve a phenomenology focused on the real
essences of the objects of consciousness, and that she had developed her theory of essences on the model of Aquinas’. Humans have an essential character and
individual humans embody that essence in different existences. By contrast, Conrad-
Martius’s will-based account is much more malleable. Because the will is open-
ended, and can desire a number of things, the soul is not fixed. The rational soul at the top of the great chain of being aims at the most rational thing, perhaps Plato’s
form of the good or wisdom. It is harder, then, to say what exactly the final cause of
humans is, without an essence to point to. Despite the enormous influence that
scholastic Aristotelianism has on these early phenomenologists, this striking development will ultimately flip Aristotle’s picture on its head. With that, we can
turn to the thinker who takes the next step in this inversion process.
 
Martin Heidegger 
 
Of Husserl’s students who followed him to his transcendental picture of
phenomenology, one dedicated to getting at the conditions which allow for the
objects of conscious experience to appear the way that they do, none stands out more
in terms of their influence on the field than Martin Heidegger. Heidegger was born into a Roman Catholic family in the small rural town of Meßkirch in
southwestern Germany. His father worked as a sexton for the church and the young
Heidegger was raised with a life in the priesthood in mind. Like Husserl, his philosophical trajectory was deeply influenced by the work of Franz Brentano, who
he first encountered in high school. Perhaps more interestingly, Heidegger is pulled
into the world of philosophy by a work of Brentano’s on Aristotle, thus keeping up
 
604 the trend of Aristotelian influence we have so far seen among the phenomenologists.
Despite his philosophical interest, Heidegger left school and joined the Jesuit Order.
However, his time in the church was short-lived, as poor health having to do with his
heart resulted in him being discharged within a year. Having caught the bug of philosophy, Heidegger enrolled at the University of Freiburg to continue his
religious training in theology but, in true phenomenological fashion, quickly
switched to studying scholasticism, along with the works of Brentano and Husserl.
After finishing his degree, Heidegger wrote a habilitation on Duns Scotus, whose
work would be an important influence on him.
 
While he had worked to set himself up for a teaching position in Catholic
philosophy at Freiburg, the outbreak of World War 1 drew him into the service. Due
to his ill-health, he spent only ten months working in a military meteorological unit.
Shortly after, he married Elfride Petri, and the two had their first son. Both partners continued to maintain romantic relationships outside of their marriage, with one
such relationship (between Elfride and the family doctor) resulting in the
Heidegger’s second son, who Martin Heidegger raised as his own. It was during this
time that Heidegger also began to teach at the University of Freiberg while working as Husserl’s assistant, before taking up a position at the University of Marburg.
There, he took up a number of students who would later make their own marks on
philosophical history. One of which was Hannah Arendt, a nineteen-year-old Jewish
student who Heidegger began a secret affair with. He also used this time to publish his most influential work, Being and Time. When Husserl’s retirement left an
opening at Freiburg, Heidegger quickly stepped in to fill the role, staying there for
the rest of his life. Within five years, Heidegger was elected rector of the university,
and within two weeks, he also joined the ascendent Nazi Party. By all accounts,
Heidegger was an enthusiastic supporter of the party’s politics, despite his lifelong friendship to that point with the Jewish Husserl and his affairs with multiple Jewish
women. He remained a loyal party member and supporter of Adolf Hitler through
until the party’s dissolution with the end of World War II. While he continued to
write throughout the war, he was eventually drafted into a civilian service role in support of the war effort digging ditches. With the closing of the war, French
authorities declared that Heidegger should be barred from participating in university
activities, including teaching, and this ban stayed in place until he was declared a
 
605
Mitläufer, a low-level Nazi collaborator for whom no charges were needed. He soon
returned to his teaching position at Freiberg and stayed on in some capacity for
almost twenty more years. He died in relative isolation, rarely receiving visitors, and
with a shadow cast upon his philosophical work as a result of his wartime activities.
 
From the time of his death in the late 1970’s to the present, many scholars have debated the exact extent that Heidegger’s philosophical views can be separated
from his political beliefs. While these debates continue to rage on, a different sort of
debate has come to a close. This is the debate on the degree to which Heidegger was
merely going along with political pressures. Some of his early defenders argued that there was little that he could do to resist the political will of the Nazi Party and so he
joined, as many Germans did, because it was expected of him in order to keep his job
and avoid potentially dangerous political consequences. This was false. A late
interview Heidegger gave with the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was not published until after his death, shows him doing little to disavow the politics of the
Nazis, and the subsequent publication of his notebooks reveals the true extent to
which Heidegger was personally antisemitic. Perhaps Heidegger’s contributions to
the project of German fascism can best be summed up by the work of his student,
Hannah Arendt, who would later coin the term the ‘banality of evil’, in her own coverage the trial of Adolf Eichmann, the SS official charged with managing the
logistics of the so-called ‘final solution’ enacted on Europe’s Jewish population:
 
“The trouble with Eichmann was precisely that so many were like
him, and that the many were neither perverted nor sadistic, that
they were, and still are, terribly and terrifyingly normal. From the
viewpoint of our legal institutions and of our moral standards of
judgment, this normality was much more terrifying than all the
atrocities put together, for it implied… that this new type of
criminal… commits his crimes under circumstances that make it
well-nigh impossible for him to know or to feel that he is doing
wrong.”222
 
Whether and to what degree we can, indeed, separate the horrible crimes
against humanity which Heidegger endorsed and enabled within his own small

606 sphere of influence over world events is an exercise left for the reader. However, it
simply cannot be denied that his work has had a profound impact on the unfolding
of the history of philosophy in his wake, and we should understand it if we are to
grapple with this fact.
 
As we have already said, phenomenology in the generation after Husserl is roughly divided along the lines of where students fall when it comes to endorsing
Husserl’s early descriptive project or his later transcendental ambitions. The
Göttingen and Munich circles endorsed the purely descriptive science of experience,
while their primary antagonist is Martin Heidegger. However, despite these debates, he still shares with them both an indebtedness to Husserl and an intense fascination
and admiration for scholastic philosophy. Husserl was a foundationalist and the
pure phenomenology of the Göttingen and Munich circles saw bracketed
consciousness as the purified foundation upon which knowledge can be built. In this way, there is a Cartesian impulse at work. Descartes had argued that our own
existence as thinking things could form the basis of absolute human knowledge
because it was still present even after taking up the methodology of radical doubt.
Where Descartes and these early phenomenologists see the lesson of bracketing as one of justifying consciousness as the first stop on the road of inquiry, Heidegger
sees this bracketing as revealing the insufficiencies of consciousness as a foundation
of knowledge.
 
The assumption so far is that we have access to our conscious experience in
some purified and genuine form ‘pre-theoretically’ and pre-existentially. We can see this in the early modern rationalist’s belief in innate ideas. The theory was that we
can access, through the exercise of the mind, knowledge that precedes the problems
of sense experience and its unreliability. However, Heidegger argues that experience
is, in some ways, grounded in existence. We are not fundamentally thinking things but doing things in a world of things which we do things with. This earthly existence
informs the character of consciousness, it presents it in various ways and according
to various ‘moods’. It is not, as Husserl and Descartes before him had hoped, pre-
theoretical. We exist and this grounded reality forms the basis for our conscious experience. The result is that we cannot investigate what it is like to be human in a
detached and theoretical way, we must confront our experience of daily life in a
material world if we are to make any headway at all. This will eventually become all
 
607 but the universally accepted position of the phenomenologists who come after
Heidegger, and we can call this movement away from pure consciousness and
towards questions of existence and being, the existential turn.
 
Without Husserl’s firm and certain base for all of human knowledge,
Heidegger has abandoned the initial reactionary impulse which had pushed Husserl
to found phenomenology in the first place.223 Heidegger, like the pragmatists, offers
us an anti-foundationalist philosophy. Anti-foundationalism attempts to provide
us with an account of knowledge in which nothing is, nor needs, be certain. As we
will see, anti-foundationalism like this will continue to rise in prominence across the philosophical landscape. On Heidegger’s version, we can best come to know the
nature of things by how they present themselves within our lived experience. When
we apply this same methodology to ourselves, we first observe that we exist prior to
experience, as we stated above. Heidegger refers to this as our ‘throwness’. We are first thrust, or thrown, into the world and values, our beliefs, and the nature of our
experience is shaped by this kind of abandonment in reality. Contrary to the
innatism we have so often seen endorsed among Heidegger’s philosophical
predecessors, Heidegger holds that we are not born with a convenient conceptual toolkit which we can draw on to establish further perfect truths. Instead, we simply
encounter the world as ‘beings-in-the-world’ or ‘dasein’. Heidegger thinks that our fundamental throwness makes it more fruitful to talk about ourselves as dasein
rather than human beings with a fixed essence rooted in an abstracted existence. When we perform this kind of analysis on the world around us, we find a very
different picture of experience and of knowledge than we have so far seen in this
philosophical tradition. Nowhere is this more readily apparent for Heidegger than in
technology and tools.
 
For Heidegger, philosophers have so far focused primarily on describing the world in concepts and in bits of language which pick those concepts out. For them,
this is simply what it would mean to have knowledge. This much is clear in Husserl’s
 
223 How much of a problem this story is for Husserl’s dream of absolute, universal, and certain knowledge is a matter of dispute. Ernst Cassirer joined Heidegger in the existentialist turn but, nevertheless, thought that such knowledge would still be possible in the moral and mathematical domain. 
 
608 hope for a descriptive science of consciousness as the foundation of knowledge. The
underlying assumption is that knowledge is, itself, a description of what it is
knowledge of. Heidegger admits that everyday objects do sometimes present
themselves like this, but it typically takes some work on our part. To understand a hammer in terms which are totally descriptive is to interrupt our regular experience
of it and to step back in consciousness and take the hammer up as an object of
observation with, for instance, a determinate and describable size, weight, color, and
shape. Heidegger calls this mode of being ‘present-at-hand’. It’s a way that things
can be in experience which enables and encourages this kind of observation as the primary mode of engagement. By contrast, Heidegger is skeptical that this is what
knowledge generally looks like. Take an expert dancer, improvisational musician,
carpenter, or surfer. None of these experts think about what they will do in
descriptive terms and then enact a plan according to rules describable in bits of language. Indeed, their knowledge is mostly non-conceptual. Consider driving a car.
At first it requires thinking about everything you are doing (e.g., stepping on the
clutch, shifting gears, easing onto the gas, easing off the clutch, etc.), but we know
we have achieved full mastery (that is, real expert knowledge) when we cease to engage with the car as present-at-hand altogether. Instead, we begin to see the car as
an extension of ourselves; it disappears in consciousness. The same is true for the
carpenter’s hammer, the surfer’s board, and the musician’s instrument. This, for
Heidegger, was Aristotle’s fatal mistake. The Parmenidean project of coming to know Being as such was left behind in the moment that Aristotle tied being to being
a substance and being a substance to being the subject of predication. If being able to
say things of things is our primary entry into knowledge, then we will set off on a
course towards trying to know them in this way. All of philosophy since Aristotle is, then, only a partial story which fails to get at the primary mode of being and our
primary path to knowledge: a kind of intimate, relational, practical knowledge.
When things present themselves in this way, like the carpenter’s hammer and the
driver’s car, Heidegger tells us that they are presented as ready-to-hand.
 
The interesting thing about looking closely at our tool use is that the way we interact with tools has, in Heidegger’s view, changed over time. The characteristic
feature of technology on Heidegger’s understanding is that it reveals possibilities. As
dasein, we are not only grounded in our existence in the world and our throwness,
 
609 but also our ‘fallenness’. By this, Heidegger means that our existence is the world
essentially takes place in time. We are temporal creatures, our lives come to an end,
and this fact gives meaning and value to our decisions. If, after all, we could live
forever, we could do everything as much as we want eventually. At this point, it would no longer mean much to choose one thing over another because, ultimately,
we could still do both. However, because we have limited time here on Earth, our
choices come with certain costs: focusing the efforts of our lives on one thing will
mean less time for other things. Opening one door in life closes another. This is what
gives our decision to do anything weight; the fact that it is what we choose to do in light of our fallenness. However, we can also see our essentially temporal nature in
our experiencing the world as full of future possibilities in general, not just with the
knowledge of our eventual death. When the sculptor sees a block of marble, they see
it as awash with such possibilities. The marble could be a man standing about casually, it could be a beautiful woman in mourning, or something else altogether.
These are choices we could enact and therefore bring into the world in the future.
What possibilities present themselves to us is, interestingly, often a result of the
technology at our disposal. If we have a hammer, we are much more likely to see hammering as a possibility, with a gene sequencing machine, genetic therapy begins
to present itself as a possibility. In this way, technology structures the decision space.
So how does modern technology shape our temporal experience as
compared to simple tools like hammers, which are merely ready-to-hand? Heidegger
claims that it reduces our experience of all things, including ourselves, to that of
‘standing reserve’. In this case, we regard ourselves as objects that are present-at-hand, combinations of properties which are relevant in determining our usefulness within
systems of production. Take a forester, of course modern forestry, as a system of
wood and paper production, sees the forests as standing reserve for use in that
production; certain kinds of trees have the possibility of being used to make different amounts of different kinds of products. Yet, the same can be said for the forester.
They are useful for producing a certain amount of raw materials in paper and wood
production. The forester is seen, and sees themselves, through the lens of a kind of
‘instrumental rationality’ (thinking of people primarily as a means to an end) with
regards to economic production. By contrast, Heidegger thinks that a better arrangement would be one in which people live authentically, in which they see
themselves as they truly are, as dasein capable of all the possibilities available to a
 
610 being-in-the-world. The philosophers who follow Heidegger down his existential
turn will take up this issue of living authentically in light of our experience as agents
choosing from among a variety of possibilities and run with it. It is to them that we
now turn.
 
Jean-Paul Sartre 
 
While there were many accomplished and original thinkers in 20th century
philosophy, there are few who can be thought to have rivalled Jean-Paul Sartre in terms of their effect on the popular imagination. Indeed, Sartre, more than any other
figure was responsible for taking phenomenology’s existential turn and turning it
into one of the most well-known philosophical positions among the public today. The effect of this has reverberated across everyday life and the arts, and it continues
to echo through to this day.
 
Jean-Paul Sartre was born in Paris. His father, a French naval officer, died
from an illness likely contracted during military travel to southeast Asia when Sartre was still a toddler. Alone, Sartre and his mother relocated to her family’s house just
outside of the city until she would remarry ten years later. Together, this new family
moved to the city of La Rochelle on the west coast of France. Sartre’s teenage years
were characterized by bullying, mostly directed at the fact that he had a wandering
blind eye. The young Sartre apparently sought refuge from this in philosophy, and quickly began attending the prestigious École Normale Supérieure, where he earned
an undergraduate and graduate degree in philosophy. He also took first place on the
highly competitive French civil service test, the agrégation. However, despite his
academic success, he also maintained an active social life during this time, gaining a reputation as a prolific prankster and beginning what would become a lifelong
intellectual and non-monogamous relationship with Simone de Beauvoir (who came
in a close second on the agrégation).224 
 
224 It is difficult to overstate the importance of Beauvoir’s own philosophical work, which will be discussed in the next section of this chapter.   
 
611
Upon completing schooling, Sartre worked in a number of academic
positions over the next eight years before being drafted into the French military as a
meteorologist. Sartre, like the rest of France, was quickly captured by German forces,
and he would spend the next nine months as a prisoner of war. It was in this confinement that Sartre began to read the work of Martin Heidegger. Eventually,
Sartre was either released due to poor eye health or used an ophthalmology
appointment in the camp as a chance to escape. While it is unclear exactly what
happened, Sartre reentered civilian life in France under German occupation and
returned to teaching. However, while living this straightforward life by day, Sartre was also briefly involved in an underground resistance group called ‘Socialism and
Liberty”, which briefly considered, at Sartre’s recommendation, assassinating French
officials which collaborated with the Nazis. Despite the group quickly dissolving,
Sartre continued to contribute to banned literary magazines and to resent the general French willingness to cohabitate with the Nazis due, in Sartre’s mind, to the
German’s good manners. One such publication was the French-Algerian
philosopher and author Albert Camus’ Combat, in which Sartre wrote articles
arguing against antisemitism, colonization, and anti-black racism in the United States. Sartre saw life under German occupation as fundamentally dismal, as Paris’
once robust intellectual scene was largely curtailed by the presence and fear of
informers. Likewise, food was scarce, and Sartre was forced to survive off of frequent
shipments of rabbits sent from a friend outside the city, which often arrived and were eaten by Sartre while filled with maggots.
 
With the end of the war, Sartre followed the larger political trend in France
which turned away from liberal capitalism, which many in the country saw as having
been characterized by its collaborationism during the war, and towards Marxism. He
remained a well-known political commentator, speaking out against the Korean and
Vietnam Wars and against the French colonization of Algeria.225 At the same time,
Sartre was criticized by his contemporaries for his defense of similar Soviet and
Maoist actions, and his frequent unwillingness to criticize human rights abuses
across the Eastern Bloc. By the end of his life, Sartre’s reputation as an author and a
 
225 Sartre was apparently drawn into the cause of Algerian independence, at least in part, by the work of Frantz Fanon. In turn, Sartre’s existentialist work was as influential on Fanon. Fanon is well known for his decolonial political philosophy and moral psychology work.  
 
612 thinker led to hm being nominated for a Nobel Prize in Literature, a nomination
which he resisted. Despite sending the Nobel Institute a letter saying that he wished
to be removed from the list and that he would not accept it if he were to win, Sartre
won and refused to accept it (having similarly refused the accept the highest French honor in 1945). To this day, he remains the only person to turn down a Nobel Prize.
Between long working hours, frequent use of cigarettes and amphetamines, and
complicating issues, Sartre’s health began to deteriorate. He is now buried in the
same grave as Simone de Beauvoir at Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris, where his
grave’s many visitors have a tradition of leaving the Paris Metro tickets used to travel to the site on the pair’s gravestone.
 
In terms of Sartre’s contributions to phenomenology, we can understand
his influence as split between the early and late stages of his career. This early period
sees Sartre working more squarely within the tradition which began with Husserl, while his latter work pushes the lessons of phenomenology beyond the confines of
merely being an academic tradition. We can take these two phases in order here.
Sartre’s first target is Husserl, and Sartre’s criticisms of Husserl cast him in the role of
Kant and Sartre himself in the role of Hume. Recall that Kant’s transcendental idealism provided us with an account of the self, albeit a minimal one. On his view,
the self is just whatever noumenal object is responsible for synthesizing the categories
and, thus, making perception possible for us in the way that it is. While we can only
know this self through its works, even this narrow path to knowledge allows us to learn some major lessons. Namely, if we can only know of the self through its works,
we can still conclude that it is an it capable of some things. In this way, Kant takes
the ego as a substance with certain properties. This view, brought on as an
assumption by Husserl, is what Sartre hopes to upend. When Husserl hopes for a
description of the nature of consciousness, he treats consciousness as the workings of an ego which is, like Kant’s, a substance capable of having certain properties. The
problem for Sartre is that if the ego is there enacting consciousness, then why don’t
we normally see it in conscious experience? For Sartre, both Kant and Husserl have
missed the key Humean insight, which is that the self is nowhere to be found in our experience. While we can posit a substantial self, and attend to the concept in
consciousness, the fact of the matter is that the ego and the act of being conscious are
both invisible in our experience under normal circumstances. Most of the time we
 
613 are not conscious of our being conscious of things, we are merely conscious of those
things directly. When we are mad at someone for cutting us off, we do not think of
ourselves being mad, in fact, we don’t think of ourselves at all. Instead, we just have a
bit of madness at them. In this way, Sartre takes Heidegger’s insight that the present-at-hand mode of presentation is unduly limiting, and he concludes that it doesn’t
even hold up to scrutiny when turned within ourselves. In effect, most perception is,
for Sartre, non-thetic: we are not consciously aware of it. For Sartre, Husserl and
Kant have it precisely backwards, it is not that the Self produces consciousness, but
that consciousness produces the self. Consciousness is a dynamic and distributed process, and much like Hume would say, the result is that we can’t help but posit a
unified substantial self, but that does not make such a posit real.
 
The implications of this insight are sweeping, and Sartre spends the second
phase of his career exploring them. If there is no substantial self which persists throughout our life, and which various properties can attach to, then little sense can
be made of all forms of essentialism. How, after all, can we as individuals be a certain
sort of thing if there is no thing around to be a certain way. In this way, our being
conscious makes humans a unique sort of creature. In keeping with the scholastic interest of his predecessors, Sartre cashes this out in terms of Aristotle. Aristotle had
argued that for every kind of thing, ourselves included, there is a final cause; an end
towards which we all strive. If, for instance, a kangaroo is born that should fail to
fulfill its essential hoppy essence, it will have failed as a kangaroo. While the final cause is not a cause in the sense we mean today, it is prior to the existence of the
individual in a certain way. This is made especially clear with manmade objects.
When a scissor manufacturer produces a pair of scissors, they first set out to make
something of a definite form and purpose. They then realize that plan in metal and
the scissors are born. By contrast, Sartre claims that, for humans, our ‘existence precedes our essence’. We are first (to borrow Heidegger’s phrase) thrown into the
world, and then we decide for ourselves what plans we intend to realize. There is no
objective standard for what a successful life will look like for us.226 Instead, we
 
226 While Sartre’s claim runs counter to Aristotle’s theory of human nature (preferring only to offer a theory of the human condition) and, accordingly, much of the religious philosophy which draws on Aristotle, other existentialists argued for distinctly religious existentialist 
614 choose it. This can be seen as the logical conclusion of Sartre’s already denying there
is an essential persisting self. Where Kant’s objects-in-themselves are capable of being
described in an essential way, whether or not we can know it, Sartre takes us humans
to be objects-for-themselves, which have a complete nothingness at our core where our essence should be, and who find themselves in the position of choosing how to
fill that hole in our soul. We are, in Sartre’s terms, “condemned to be free” to choose
our path on Earth.227 This position, that our existence precedes our essence and that
we must therefore make a meaning for our own lives, Sartre calls existentialism. It
is the view that there is no human nature, only the human condition: one of being radically free.
 
However, Sartre goes further than pointing this out. Like Heidegger, Sartre
is concerned with how to live authentically in light of our human condition. To
understand how we might do this, we should first understand how not to, as Sartre thinks that most of us do not. All the time, we essentialize about our own natures.
When a friend invites us to a party, we say we are introverts. When approached by a
devilish rogue, we say that we can’t run away with them because we are married.
This kind of language essentializes our existence. We, in effect, take a description of how we have been as a prescription for how we should continue to be. What we can
really say is that we have been introverted and that we have been married. Beyond
this, we can choose to stay introverted, and we continuously choose to stay married
every day in small moments like this. That is, of course, a perfectly fine thing to do. What is inauthentic, for Sartre, is pretending that we don’t always have a choice.
 
philosophies. To be clear, Sartre himself would gladly allow someone to be a Christian and an existentialist (so long as they recognized that they were choosing it rather than it being necessary). However, these other thinkers sought to reconcile their own commitments to existentialism with their religious beliefs. First, there are Gabriel Marcel and Karl Jaspers. Marcel used the lack of essences in the world as a way of understanding the world’s ‘fallenness’ in Christian thought (or what he would call its ‘brokenness’. Meanwhile, while Karl Jaspers remained a Christian, his work argues against orthodox religions on existentialist grounds. Finally, there is Martin Buber, a Jewish thinker whose most famous work, I and Thou, explores a phenomenology of social relationships.   227 Jean-Paul Sartre, Existentialism and Human Emotions, trans. Bernard Frechtman (New York: Citadel Press, 1985): 23. 
 
615
Such a life, spent condemning ourselves to perpetuate our same patterns, is to live in
bad faith.
 
Why, then, do so many people live in bad faith? Because it is tempting to.
When we say that we can’t do this or that we are this way, we attempt to push
responsibility for our choices onto someone or something else. When Sartre says that we are condemned to be free, he is not being dramatic. With our radical freedom to
be whatever we want comes responsibility for those choices. We are, all the time,
asked to make choices, and this fact brings with it a great deal of anxiety.228 We will
ultimately face blame and punishment if we choose badly and we will face praise and reward if we choose wisely. This all seems to suggest that there is a right answer, or at
least some potentially bad ones. Yet, despite this, there is no way of knowing which
choice to pick. We bear all the responsibility of our freedom and face all of its
uncertainty. Running from this, running from life, many people choose to live a life of bad faith instead. We convince ourselves that we do have fixed right answers, but
these are no more substantial than the shadows on Plato’s cave walls. To live
authentically is, for Sartre, to always choose the course of our life in light of our
radical freedom. Marry and stay married, stay in or go out, any option is fine, the important thing is that we always admit to ourselves that we are enacting what we
want, not doing what we have to do. This is the lesson of existentialism.
 
Simone de Beauvoir 
 
While Sartre is the philosopher who first articulates existentialism as a
distinct philosophical position and who grounds it in the methodology of
phenomenology, it is Simone de Beauvoir who does more than anyone to work out its implications. She systematizes the first comprehensive account of existentialist
ethics and her book, The Second Sex, laid the groundwork for the emergence of
feminism’s ‘second wave’. Where first wave feminism focused more on
enfranchisement and formal equality (such as in the work of Mary Wollstonecraft and Harriet Taylor Mill), this new second-wave began pushing the economic rights
 
228 Notice the influence of so-called proto existentialists like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. 
 
616 and independence of women to the forefront of these discussions. In all, it is
incredibly difficult to overstate the significance of Beauvoir’s legacy as both an
existentialist and as a feminist, two things which are not cleanly separable.
 
Beauvoir was born into a well-to-do Parisian family. Her father, an atheist
and a self-styled intellectual, had attended law school and worked as a civil servant, while her mother ensured that the children’s family life was structured around
traditional Roman Catholic values and institutions. The young Beauvoir was known
for her rebellious streak, and she vowed to never live as a housewife like her mother
had. While he was, himself, still quite conservative, Beauvoir saw more to admire in her father and his intelligence. She got into frequent conflicts with her mother while,
at the same time, her father introduced her to literature and writing. By the time she
attended a private Catholic all-girls school, she began to garner a reputation for her
willingness to reject more traditional notions of femininity. Despite these confrontations, Beauvoir was clearly a gifted student, and she also became
increasingly interested in philosophy. This studying ultimately led her to reject her
faith and become an atheist at the age of fourteen. The flames of this burgeoning
intellectual interest were kindled when economic hardships led to a massive loss in her family’s wealth, including the money set aside as her dowry. Now, without the
possibility of being pressured into a marriage of economic arrangement, Beauvoir
found herself free to commit herself fully to her education. She completed her
primary school education and began attending the Sorbonne. There, she received a B.A. and an M.A., writing her thesis on the work of Leibniz. She also became the
youngest person to ever pass the agrégation, finishing second only to Jean-Paul Sartre
(who had already taken the test once), and making her only the eighth woman to
have passed the exam. Sartre and Beauvoir also became friends, lovers, and
intellectual collaborators, with both thinkers relying on the other to sharpen their own arguments and positions. The pair began and continued a lifelong non-
monogamous relationship, with Beauvoir being romantically involved with a
number of men and women throughout her life.
 
With her education now behind her, Beauvoir took up an academic position, becoming the youngest philosophy teacher in France. Shortly after taking
up this role, the Nazi occupation of France began, and Beauvoir was quickly
dismissed from her teaching duties by the Nazi government for her advocacy of
 
617 feminism after complaints by parents that she was corrupting their daughter. This
experience, and that of German occupation in general, pushed her towards the
political and the ethical. She dedicated herself more fully to her writing ambitions
and quickly established herself as one of the country’s most preeminent novelists. During this time, she also, along with Sartre and others, began a brief period of
intellectual resistance against the Nazis, and the group became more radical and
progressive. When the war came to an end, the ethical and political thought that had
been forming during occupation finally materialized into a complete book of
philosophy, The Ethics of Ambiguity. This was quickly followed up in two years with the publication of her feminist magnum opus, The Second Sex. This flurry of
productivity, along with her high-profile relationship with Sartre, launched her even
further into world-wide fame. She would continue to be a notable public
commentator, political activist (especially on the cause of ending the French occupation of Algeria), and essayist. She would die six years after Sartre, in 1986,
from a pulmonary edema.
 
Like Sartre, Beauvoir is committed to the core existentialist idea that
existence precedes essence. Further, like Sartre, she holds that the consequence of anti-essentialism is that we should abandon any attempt to describe human nature in
favor of understanding the human condition. That is, because we are first thrown
into the world, and then must go about making meaning for ourselves, anything
universally knowable or practical for all people must be grounded in the common situation we humans find ourselves in. In her case, Beauvoir thinks that the human
condition is fundamentally one of ambiguity. This ambiguity is the result of our being a subject to ourselves but an object to the world. As Sartre has already argued,
there is a nothingness at our core, we lack an essence of our own, and this is the basic
cause of our freedom. Where a croissant has an essence (e.g., three layers of enriched pastry dough, butter, laminated using three turns, etc.) and is thus condemned to be
a croissant, our throwness opens up the possibility of our choosing for ourselves
what to be. This experience, as a creature with a subjective point of view, and with
freedoms and desires for ourselves and our lives, is contrasted with our experience being treated like an object by the world. The world can act on us causally. It can
stymie our plans in radical ways, diverting the course of our life in directions we
 
618
would never endorse.229 Still, at the same time, our subjectness always allows us to
want more or different than our objectification by the world has given us.
Navigating this ambiguity is, then, the task of a human life. Of course, just as Sartre
has said, many of us deny our situation and live in bad faith. However, for Beauvoir, this is not just to deny that we are free, but also to deny our ‘facticity’ as objects in
the world. While freedom is a core part of our experience, living an authentic life is
one of accepting the ambiguity at the core of human life.
 
Before showing us what it would look like to embrace ambiguity and live
authentically, Beauvoir surveys a number of ways to live in bad faith by denying it. First, there is the ‘sub-man’. The sub-man denies their ambiguity by denying their
subjectness altogether. Instead, they allow themselves to be treated totally as an
object by the world. When they find themselves moved, perhaps to join a mob or to
go along with what others say or do, they simply allow it to happen. This is, for Beauvoir, the lowest form of life for creatures like us. Next, we find the ‘serious
man’, who asserts their freedom, but grounds it in an objective standard. Values are,
for the serious man, absolute. The serious man is free, and so recognize their
subjectness, but subordinate themselves to something else and, thus, deny their complete freedom. This is most similar to Sartre’s account of bad faith, and, like
Sartre, Beauvoir holds that this is the most common response to the ambiguity of
our situation; we tell ourselves that we must do what is expected of us by the
universal truth of our, often, religious or political commitments. In this way, we might think of Beauvoir’s criticisms of the serious man as akin to Nietzsche’s
complaints about the selflessness of slave morality. However, many serious men will
ultimately see that they have subordinated themselves to a cause not worth fighting
or living for and will react by rebelling. Beauvoir calls this person the ‘nihilist’.
Because they have found one account (an incorrectly objective account in Beauvoir’s view) to be fundamentally flawed and wrong, they erroneously deny that there is
 
229 Notice the similarities to Fichte’s account of the absolute subject-object, but also to Leibniz’s theory of pre-established harmony, in which the world of meaning and reasons is overlayed with the world of causes. This is, perhaps no coincidence, as Beauvoir’s M.A. thesis was on the work of Leibniz. 
 
619 meaning altogether. The lesson of existentialism, however, is not that there is no
meaning, but that we make it.
 
On the other side, we also have those who deny ambiguity while still
asserting their own freedom. First there is the ‘adventurer’, who uses their freedom to
accomplish projects of their own choosing, but these projects don’t mean anything to them. It is not so much that they desired something beyond the object world as it
is, but that they enjoy doing in general. Here, we can look at a mercenary. The
mercenary fights for the sake of fighting, they don’t fight for a cause they see as
worth pursuing in and of itself. They have asserted their own freedom to choose but, at the same time, they deny that their actions make meaning and value. Without
asserting meaning and value, the adventurer opens themselves up to use others,
because they only care about the doing of things and not what those things mean.
Finally, there is the ‘passionate man’, who does choose projects for themselves and think the ends those projects work towards are meaningful but is willing to realize
this end at the expense of others. This is a denial of ambiguity because the ambiguity
we are called to live our lives in light of is a feature of the human condition, not just
our own situation. We are all, in virtue of being thrown into the world with a nothingness at our core, simultaneously subjects and objects. To treat others as mere
objects is to deny this fundamental truth.230 Indeed, this is what oppressors do, they
see other humans as mere objects. Just as we can convince ourselves that we must
essentially be a certain way and live in bad faith, so too can we convince ourselves that others lack freedom and are mere objects. Beauvoir refers to this process as
‘mystification’. There are a number of mystifications which emerge to convince
those in the dominant class that their oppression is justified. Nowhere is this more
easily demonstrated, for Beauvoir, than in the treatment of women.
 
Drawing inspiration from both Sartre and Hegel, Beauvoir argues that the self is always constituted by being posited against that which is not the self. Yet, it is
Fichte, not Hegel, who best explains Beauvoir’s thinking. Recall Fichte’s claim that
the I posits itself as an I through a process of confrontation with the not-I. For
Fichte, the not-I that makes positing ourselves possible is the limitations on our

620 freedom. Something similar can be seen in Sartre, where the ego or the self is posited
through consciousness, by our taking up the activity of consciousness as an object to
be investigated and engaged with thetically. Beauvoir notices that something similar
happened with man’s positing of self. To take up ‘men’ as an idea is to separate it off from what else there is, to draw a line around it separating it from that which is not
man and thereby pick out an object which we can analyze and compare to things.
Men, Beauvoir claims, define themselves as self, and the category ‘woman’ exists only
as man’s other, that which is not self. Of course, we expected Beauvoir to deny the
possibility of their being an essence to womanhood, such as ‘adult human female’, because she denies all human essences altogether. In this way, Beauvoir is, like
Sulabhā before her in the 8th century B.C.E., a gender non-essentialist. However, this
does not mean that all talk of gender is meaningless. Instead, Beauvoir endorses a
form of social constructivism about gender.231 That is, as we have seen, gender is constructed socially. In this case, woman is constructed as the other to man’s self.
 
While it is true that there are factual differences that generally separate men
from women, no account of the facts of gender will capture an essence and attempts
to ground womanhood in some single essence are mere mystifications which allow men to perpetuate their systemic oppression of women. For instance, the biological
essentialist about gender, who claims that women all necessarily share some
underlying biological essence, will say that women experience menstruation and
pregnancy and this is, in part, what they share in common. However, this is, for Beauvoir, a retreat to describing women in object terms and away from fully
recognizing their subjectness. In turn, these ‘factual’ biological differences are
employed in justifying how and why women are treated differently from men. It is
the same bad faith move we saw in our discussion of Sartre but applied to the other.
When we indulge in essentialism, we inevitably take descriptions and labels as prescriptions for how things must be, it is only that in this case, men are engaging in
bad faith in essentializing women. In effect, the gender essentialist is, for Beauvoir,
asserting a universality and, in doing so, denying the individuality of those subjected
 
231 A version of this will later be endorsed by the philosopher Judith Butler, whose work on gender will be instrumental in the development of queer theory, the branch of philosophy which applies the critical lens that feminist philosophy does to the role of women in society to gender more broadly and to sexuality.  
 
621 to it. However, because the truth of women’s total equality with men entails that
they are individual subjects and not merely universal objects, women will always defy
these kinds of reductive stories. The result is that any attempt to capture the essence
of women must become self-contradictory in order to accommodate the various ways that women are. Women must be innocent girls and seductive temptresses,
mothers and lovers, and both maternal protectors and damsels in distress. This
inherently contradictory story, which Beauvoir calls the ‘Eternal Feminine’ sets every
woman up for failure, because an impossible descriptive account of women’s essence
is taken as a prescription for how women ought to be (an impossible task).
 
Women are brought into being subjects of the Eternal Feminine not by their
biology, which bears no relation to the expectations of femininity, but through a
process of socialization. This can be seen in the fact that girls don’t become women
by merely growing and developing biologically, through puberty itself. They are brought into womanhood through rituals of puberty, in which they learn to assign
particular social meanings to their biology and to their actions. In this way, “one is
not born, but rather becomes, a woman.”232 That is, no one is a ‘biological woman’,
because to take one’s social position to issue from a biological description, and to constrain what we are or could be, is to live in bad faith. This has the more
controversial consequence, which Beauvoir endorses, that women’s status as man’s
other resembles that of the person who lives in bad faith. Not only do men have their
oppression of women mystified, but women can also be tempted to flee from responsibility for their choices in the same way that anyone else can. Where the bad
faith Christian or Kantian claims that they must behave a certain way because they
have no choice given the kind of thing they are, women might hide from the
responsibility of their freedom by allowing themselves to believe they have an
essence. In this case, women will endorse their own position as an object for men, in order to limit their own freedom and they thereby subject themselves to the demands
of the Eternal Feminine. Thus, to live in genuine freedom, for women, is to avoid
such bad faith. True freedom, equality, and subjectness will take women
empowering themselves through universal childcare, access to quality education, access to family planning, and (most importantly for Beauvoir) work. The married
 
232 Simone de Beauvoir, The Second Sex, trans. H.M. Parshley (London: Jonathan Cape, 1953): 273  
 
622 homemaker is drawn into giving men power over them, and into allowing themselves
to be held at the whims of mystified men. It is simply too compelling for any person
to have the opportunity to hide from life in bad faith, as the anxiety of our ambiguity
can be unbearable at times.
 
The lessons Beauvoir learns in exploring questions of gender can be utilized more widely. For one thing, because Beauvoir denies essentialism more generally, all
attempts to essentialize people into categories are a kind of mystification, whether
that is in terms of gender, race, or anything else. Like Sartre, she thinks that authentic
living is a matter of refusing to live in bad faith for ourselves. However, she has also gone beyond Sartre, by arguing that genuine freedom requires recognizing the
freedom of others as well.
 
Maurice Merleau-Ponty 
 
What we have seen so far, across the history of phenomenology, is a
movement away from the abstract, disembodied approach of Husserl to one that is ever more grounded in our physical existence. With Heidegger’s existential turn, we
saw the necessity of understanding ourselves not just as beings (perhaps akin to
Descartes’ ‘thinking things’), but as beings-in-the-world. Nowhere is the import of
this more obvious, for Heidegger, than in our use of tools and technology. From this,
Sartre derives the claim that existence precedes essence, that our thrownness leaves an essential nothingness at our core. In effect, Sartre localizes the focus of
phenomenology even closer to our physical self, as we now analyze our own
existence even outside of tool use, when it is just us alone existing in the world.
Finally, Beauvoir recognized the ways in which power plays out on the body, in the interpretation of ‘biological facts’. As it turns out, false and bad faith understandings
of what women are will work to justify their second-class status by essentializing their
biology and rooting their oppression in that imagined essence. This general trend, of
moving down from the rarified realm of abstract objects in pure consciousness and towards a more embodied approach, reaches its fullest expression in the work of
Maurice Merleau-Ponty.
 
623
Merleau-Ponty was born into a Roman Catholic family in the seaside city of
Rochefort in the center of France’s Atlantic coast. His father, an artillery captain,
died during World War I, moving Merleau-Ponty’s family to Paris. There, he
maintained an especially close relationship with his mother and lived, by all accounts, a very happy life. He also excelled in school, and a first-place prize in his philosophy
class piqued his interest in continuing to study within the field. This sent him to the
École Normale Supérieure, where he would be a classmate with Sartre, and where he
would become friends with Beauvoir as well. In the year following Beauvoir and
Sartre’s outstanding performances on the agrégation, Merleau-Ponty himself came in second. Like many of his peers, Merleau-Ponty took up a teaching role after
completing his schooling and remained an active scholar during this time. He was
the first foreign researcher to visit the newly founded Husserl Archives, attended
many lectures by prominent thinkers inside and outside of philosophy, and published a number of works before the outbreak of World War II. With the war
now underway, Merleau-Ponty spent a year as an infantry lieutenant before being
wounded. By the time he could recover, France had already surrendered to German
occupation. He returned to his teaching position in Paris, got married, and joined in Sartre and Beauvoir’s resistance efforts.  It was just before the end of the war that
Merleau-Ponty published his magnum opus, The Phenomenology of Perception,
which he capitalized on by leapfrogging between a number of academic positions,
teaching at the University of Lyon, having a young Michel Foucault as a student at the École Normale Supérieure, and working as a Professor of Child Psychology and
Pedagogy at the University of Paris. At this point, he became the youngest person
ever to be elected as the Chair of Philosophy at the Collège de France, the most
prestigious position for a philosopher in France at the time.
 
By the time of the Korean War, political differences over the promise of revolutionary Marxism drove a wedge between Merleau-Ponty on one side and
Sartre and Beauvoir on the other (with Merleau-Ponty taking the side of left
liberalism and the others taking a more Marxist approach). A long public feud
emerged in print, and the trio were never able to completely resolve their issues. Despite this, Merleau-Ponty remained an active political commentator on issues of
race and colonialism, declining to be appointed into France’s Order of the Legion of
Honor on the basis of French human rights abuses in colonial Algeria, and was active
 
624 in France’s non-communist political left. This work was cut short when, at the age of
53, Merleau-Ponty died of a stroke while preparing for class. He is now buried in
Père Lachaise Cemetery, also home to the tomb of Héloïse and Abelard.
 
In terms of his philosophical views, philosophy has, for Merleau-Ponty,
long bought into a distinction between the mind and the body. While many philosophers have tried to reconcile these two things, by developing answers to the
‘mind-body problem’, they still assume a divide between these two things in the first
place. In fact, philosophers’ tendency to think of themselves as, most fundamentally,
a mind distinct from a body is, for Merleau-Ponty, the underlying cause of a great deal of confusion from rationalism down to the present. This is, in his view, the
lesson of the existential turn; we can’t really understand ourselves or our experience
without understanding how it grounded in the world. On the other hand,
empiricism has made an equally bad blunder in the representationalist model which sets objects outside of the mind and ideas inside of it, only weakly tethered together
through the senses. The more scientific approach to knowledge put forward by the
empiricists focuses on trying to understand the objects in and of themselves without
first understanding how our mind structures our perception of them. The moral of this story is that neither the physical world of the body nor the mental world of the
mind are completely independent from one another, and if we are to understand
anything, we must first understand the body-subject as a single unified thing which
exists in the world and which mediates and creates our experience of it. Instead of taking our minds as the subject, who can study our body as an object, we should
think about the body, together with the mind, as forming the basic unit of
experience.
 
With this picture in mind, Merleau-Ponty concludes that both perception
and thought have a kind of embodiment. For instance, when your crush asks you out on a date, it’s not that you think about it, decide it would be a good idea and, on
the basis of this, feel excited. Instead, how you think and feel about this is one and
the same with your feeling butterflies in your stomach. Your excitement isn’t a
rational thought or purely mental feeling that then causes events in the body, our thinking is embodied. The same is true for perception. For, for example, listening to
music. We don’t first hear the rhythm of Charli XCX’s “360” and then decide to
move along with it consciously. Instead, we perceive the rhythm through our own
 
625 spontaneous movements. Our perception, like our cognition, involves the whole
body. Our lives, it turns out, are replete with examples like these. Once we truly
recognize the interdependence of the body-subject, worries like the mind-body
problem hardly make sense. After all, why would we feel the need to reconcile two things which aren’t, themselves, distinct in the first place.
 
Yet, the continental philosophical tradition was not alone in questioning the
standard divisions of philosophy. Just as Heidegger pushed phenomenology away
from essentialist analysis, philosophy in the anglophone world saw a similar
movement towards a more diversified methodological approach and towards anti-foundationalism. However, this was, just as it was for continental philosophy, a
contentious process of growth and development, and not without its detractors even
now. It is to this story that we now turn.

Philosophy 
 
While the early phenomenologists of the continental philosophical tradition
can be seen as a reaction to the suspicious views of thinkers like Marx and Nietzsche,
another anti-skeptical reaction was also brewing which would eventually take the anglophone tradition by storm. Pragmatism had developed a strong foothold in
America, and utilitarianism remained a significant force within moral philosophy,
idealism had become the dominant philosophical outlook on matters of metaphysics
and epistemology in Britian. We have already seen the presence of idealism within this tradition, in figures like George Berkeley, and Constance Naden already stands
out as a significant British idealist of the period. Yet, it was Naden’s contemporary,
Francis Herbert Bradley, who was seen as the central figure of British idealism.233
While this school is varied, unique, and interesting, it should be enough for our purposes to say that Bradley argued for idealism as a rejection of our commonsense
view of the world, where the apparent pluralism of the world should be rejected in
favor of an idealistic monism.234 This was the view that typified British philosophy at
the time. It is against this backdrop that we can begin to understand the
development of analytic philosophy.
 
233 Meanwhile, Josiah Royce is seen as the central figure of idealism in America from the time period, though he is also sometimes counted a pragmatist. This area of overlap between idealism and pragmatism should not be surprising to us, given what we know about pragmatism and its historical development.   
234 Notice the similarities between this view and that of Parmenides as far back as the Presocratics. 
 
629
Analytic philosophy emerges principally out of the influence of three
central figures: G.E. Moore, Gottlob Frege, and Bertrand Russell. The British
philosopher G.E. Moore sees himself as the great defender of common sense, in the
model of Berkeley, but this time on the side of realism. Moore criticizes Bradley’s idealism on the basis that skepticism about the reality of a mind independent world
(the noumenal realm) requires that we give up our belief in something obvious to
assert a belief in something non-obvious. To get to this point Moore begins by
discussing what it means to prove anything. In this case, proving something to be
true involves taking what we already know and leveraging it to get new knowledge. For instance, you can use your knowledge that 1) if there’s smoke, then there’s fire
and 2) that there is smoke, to prove that 3) there is fire. The premises, in this case,
constitute the data that we have at our disposal in order to conclude anything. The
problem, Moore argues, is that skepticism about the external world denies the data that we have. We can see external objects all around us (at least, apparently). We see
tables, treefrogs, turnips, and Toyotas. At the very least, we can all see our hands as
having a physical existence. When the skeptic asks, “well how do you know that your
hands exist external to you?”, they deny the data we have available to prove anything. The result, in his view, is that the skeptic denies the possibility of proving anything.
No argument can be considered sound if we deny the premises, so the skeptic has
given us not only an impossible task, to prove something without using any data,
they have already asserted what they wanted us to conclude. By being skeptical of the premises in this case, they have cooked the books in their favor. Of course, we will
doubt the existence of the external world if we are not allowed to use our knowledge
of external objects to prove its existence. The larger methodological consequence of
this argument is that proofs require using obvious claims to conclude less obvious claims, and that this means we should not overturn something obvious in order to
conclude something less obvious, as that would constitute denying the data available
to us. It is, in effect, to surrender on the project of proving anything. The widespread
adoption of this heuristic can be said to constitute a ‘Moorean shift’.
 
Moore’s shift is important in the history of philosophy because it will result in a radical change in the way that philosophy is done. Going back to the time of
Parmenides, Xenophanes, and Socrates, the role of the philosopher has been, in
many ways, one of criticizing the received or commonsense view. Parmenides
 
630 asserted pure being and denied plurality and change, despite the fact that the world
appears to be many and in flux. Meanwhile, Xenophanes and Socrates were explicitly
critical of their society’s received opinions on matters of religion, morality, and
justice. The history of philosophy is, in many ways, littered with the great works of those that stood outside what was seen as commonsense. By contrast, here, in the
analytic tradition, we have Moore and those downstream of them taking our
commonsense intuitions as evidence or data and not something to be suspicious of.
This puts them in stark contrast with the suspicious attitudes which characterize
much of continental philosophy. While this distinction is not perfect, there are many non-critical continental philosophers and vice versa, this difference in attitude
towards the significance of commonsense intuitions does constitute a general
division between the traditions.
 
At the same time that Moore was developing his commonsense philosophy,
the German philosopher Gottlob Frege was involved in a very different project concerning proof. Frege was very interested in the ways in which mathematicians
were proving theorems. He was seeking greater, almost mathematical, precision from
the arguments of philosophy. While Aristotle’s system of propositional logic (in which the basic building blocks are propositions) had stood almost unchanged for
two millennia, the early twentieth century saw Frege develop a new ‘predicate logic’.
Instead of leaving entire sentences intact and manipulating their relations to one
another, predicate logic takes predication, rather than whole propositions, as the basic logical unit of language. Where the sentence ‘a dog is on a log’ might have been
taken in whole and represented as ‘D’ in propositional logic, it can be broken down
into subordinate logical parts within predicate logic. For instance, the same sentence
might be translated as ‘ⱻx(Dx & Oxl)’, which is to say that ‘there exists a creature
such that that creature has the property of being a dog and that creature has the property of being in the on relation to a log’. The difference, in this case, is that, in
contrast to propositional logic, predicate logic doesn’t just reveal the structure
governing the relationships between propositions, but the logical structure within
them. While predicate logic is an incredibly powerful tool in this way, it should be enough for our purposes to say that Frege made a convincing argument that we can
think of truth as being describable in terms like a mathematical or computational
function. This emphasis on almost mathematical or scientific precision in language,
 
631 and on the role of formal logic in clarifying the nature of arguments will, like
Moore’s commonsense shift, become a characteristic feature of analytic philosophy.
 
Finally, it was the British philosopher Bertrand Russell who would begin
the project of synthesizing the work of Moore and Frege. Russell began his
philosophical life as a Hegelian but was ultimately swayed away from the position by Moore. However, he was also deeply invested in the work that Frege was doing in
Germany. From Moore, he took the rejection of idealistic monism and an emphasis
on the philosophy conducted through careful analysis of the meanings of words, as
Moore had done for the idea of proof. From Frege, Russell takes the functional
account of truth. Together, these form the basis of his logical atomism. According to this position, simple particular facts determine the truth of larger statements when
computed logically. For instance, consider a sentence like “Victoria was attacked by a
raccoon.” This sentence means something, but so do the words that make it up. We can say what it means to be attacked or to be a raccoon. However, we cannot
perform a similar move in breaking down these words. The phonemes that make up
these words are not themselves meaningful, these basic sounds are just gibberish on
their own. In this way, we can say that words are the ‘atomic’ meaningful unit of language. They are the smallest bit of language with any meaning. When combined
to form predications like the ones Frege described using predicate logic, we get to the
atomic truthful units of language. We wouldn’t say that its true or false that ‘racoon’,
but we can say that it is either true or false that ‘Victoria was attacked by one.’ Then, using formal logic, we can prove subsequent claims by applying logical functions to
these truthful facts. Notice that this very much follows both Moore and Frege’s ideas
about proof. By getting clear about the meanings of words, we can derive new
knowledge from more basic claims (ala Moore), and we can do this through the
application of logical functions (ala Frege).
 
Russell’s logical atomism will have a profound impact on analytic
philosophy. On this picture, we have preserved a place for philosophers within a
world in which science seems to eclipse it every day. Science can tell us whether
individual facts are true, as these facts point at the world, while philosophers can clarify the meanings of the terms which make up those facts. Thus, the project of
human inquiry falls largely along the lines laid out by Kant, with the scientists
governing over the domain of synthetic statements and philosophers having
 
632 jurisdiction over the analytic statements. This vision of the role of philosophy is
from where analytic philosophy derives its name. The job of the philosopher is to
analyze our concepts and to clarify the meanings of our terms using the data of
science and commonsense intuitions. To provide an account of the meaning of a
term in this way is to engage in conceptual analysis. This is the foundation of the early analytic philosophical project. Yet, just as later phenomenologists would go on
to push that project into a number of new territories, sometimes outright rejecting
its most fundamental assumptions, so too will philosophers in the analytic tradition.
 
The Logical Positivists 
 
While the seeds of analytic philosophy were sewn in the work of Frege,
Moore, and Russell, it was another group of thinkers that would push it to its
current status as the dominant tradition in the anglophone world. These were the
logical positivists. Logical positivism (sometimes referred to as ‘logical empiricism') is the view which combines logical atomism with empiricism, such that anything
that does not fall into the purview of either philosophy (narrowly construed to mean
conceptual analysis) or science is literally without meaning. This constitutes a particularly strong, particularly scientific, and particularly narrow form of analytic
philosophy. While Russell had laid the groundwork for philosophy and science
having their own domains, in dealing with analytic and synthetic statements
respectively, the logical positivists see no real room for any other way of knowing or
doing inquiry beyond this. This view emerges in the early 20th century out of a group of philosophers in Vienna. Accordingly, this school has come to be known as the
‘Vienna circle’.
 
While a number of influential thinkers were involved in the Vienna circle, including the philosopher Otto Neurath and the mathematician Kurt Gödel, we can
think of its two central figures as Moritz Schlick and Rudolf Carnap. Schlick and his
colleagues were heavily influenced by the Austrian physicist and philosopher of
science Ernst Mach. Mach held a particularly strong for of empiricism which
became the basis for positivism. In his view, the mind can only know through
 
633 sensation. This is, itself, simply a statement of empiricism, but Mach goes further in
arguing that the role of scientific theory is just to predict future sensations. Scientific
theories are, in essence, systems of prediction. Accordingly, different theories can be
evaluated based on how well they predict future events which are ultimately observable through the senses. This should strike you as very much along the lines of
the scientific method we are taught in school. Scientists predict what will happen in
forming a hypothesis, and successful theories (like the theory of evolution) have a
great deal of predictive power. This model of science is taken up by Moritz Schlick
and the rest of the Vienna circle as a larger theory of inquiry overall. In this case, whether a statement is true or not is a matter of whether it can be verified
empirically. This is to say that statements can only be true if they follow Mach’s
standard for scientific theories or can be broken down into subordinate claims that
do. For instance, it may be enough to verify that ‘the cat is on the mat’ by checking with our sense whether we can see a cat on the mat. More complex claims may
require being broken down into subsequent claims and verifying them. In this case,
we can think of Einstein’s famous ‘Eddington Expedition’. Here, Einstein is said to
have verified his claim that general relativity is true based on the observation of an eclipse off the coast of West Africa and in a town in the northeast corner of Brazil.
While the truth of general relativity cannot be observed directly, the theory can be
broken down into a number of claims, including the inference that if the theory is
true, then the gravity of the sun will deflect light during that eclipse. This claim was predicted by the theory and verified by sense experience in the observations of
scientists on the expedition. The result of the Vienna circle taking this as a model for
assessing all claims is that claims simply refer to (or mean) the conditions under
which they can be verified. This idea, that the meanings of statements are just a matter of the conditions under which they can be empirically verified, and that their
truth is just a matter of whether they are, indeed, verified, can be called the
verification principle (or sometimes referred to as ‘verificationism’).
 
Despite its straightforward and simple appearance, the verification principle
has sweeping and dramatic consequences for philosophy. This can be seen in the
work of Rudolf Carnap. Carnap argues that if the verification principle is true, and he thinks it is, that this means that all of metaphysics and philosophy of religion is
meaningless. Claims about free-will, for instance, had better be reducible to some
 
634 kind of empirical prediction, or they mean nothing at all. The same is true for talk of
the essences of things and for statements about God’s existence. Note that it is not
that Carnap is denying the existence of God. In his view, that can’t be settled either
way because it is not an empirical question. Because God is said to exist outside of the physical, observable, world, talk of his, her, or their existence is ultimately
meaningless. This consequence of positivism meant that as it increased in popularity,
we would also see a decline in respect for these traditional philosophical topics. This
is seen quite visibly in Carnap’s famous debate with Heidegger, in which Carnap
argues that most of Heidegger’s claims cannot be verified empirically and are, therefore, meaningless. This kind of animosity would eventually become mutual,
leaving the divide between the two traditions (analytic and continental) more
entrenched than ever. Whereas before they were simply distinct conversations which
sometimes interacted, both sides now took the other to be a destructive perversion of the field of philosophy, with continental philosophers often arguing that the
positivists are overly restricted by their love of the scientific method and of formal
logic, and the positivists claiming that continental philosophy is primarily
characterized by meaningless and imprecise claims which can’t be proven true or false.
 
Yet, the implications of the verification principle for philosophy do not end
there. By the time that it was introduced to Britian, it had achieved a standard answer
on the question of moral philosophy as well.235 The person largely responsible for
importing positivism into England was the British philosopher A.J. Ayer. Ayer argued that the verification principle also meant that ethical claims were meaningless,
as there is no way to empirically verify the badness of murder or the goodness of
charity. Instead, we should understand moral claims as simply expressions of
emotion. That lying is morally wrong isn’t something that can be true or false on Ayer’s view, and to say so is simply to say something equivalent to “boo lying!” or “I
don’t like lying!”. This position can be called ‘expressivism’ (or is sometimes called
‘emotivism’) because it views moral claims as non-factual and merely expressive of
 
235 There was a significant amount of ethical theorizing at this point in analytic philosophy outside of what is discussed here. For instance, Iris Murdoch developed an analytic form of Neoplatonist moral philosophy and Mary Midgley, whose work explores the ethical implications of various interpretations of evolution and human nature. 
 
635 some emotional response. For Ayer, the same thing is true for aesthetic claims as well.
Taken together with the claims of Carnap, positivism leaves little room for
philosophers to work. However, positivism is not totally free from value theory yet.
Susan Stebbing, another notable British positivist, thought that the view had implications for politics. In her view, many of the claims that characterize political
discourse are fundamentally unclear.236 Political conflict is, in her view, exacerbated
by the fact that those involved often aren’t clear about the conditions under which
their claims could be proven true or false, and use the expressive power of language
to manipulate others. Likewise, the original members of the Vienna circle were largely critical of the rise of Nazism and appealed to its fundamental anti-
intellectualism in their critiques of the regime. Claims about the purity of the
people’s community (‘volksgemeinschaft’) could not be verified under any
circumstances and, are therefore meaningless as well. This stance, combined with the fact that most of the circle’s members were Jewish, led to Schlick’s assassination by a
deranged student and to many members fleeing to Britian and the United States,
where they would make logical positivism the dominant view.
 
Logical positivism’s external success at being spread across the world did not, however, translate to internal success in working out the details of the view.
Already, the cracks are starting to show. First, there is the issue of rationally
grounding the verification principle. The principle tells us that anything which
cannot be verified by science is meaningless, and only those claims that actually are verified in this way are true. This led many to begin to ask whether the verification
principle itself could be verified by science. The truth of the claim doesn’t seem to be
the sort of thing that can be settled either way through observation, and it certainly
isn’t the case that it has been verified by science. Beyond this there is the question of
whether verification is even actually the way that science works. Here, Karl Popper, a sometimes associate of the Vienna circle and attendee of its meetings, pointed out
 
236 One of Stebbing’s students, Elsie Whetnall, apparently played a significant role in influencing Stebbing’s work (by Stebbing’s admission in the preface of her book A Modern Introduction to Logic. Whetnall herself would go on to do work clarifying the distinction between (but also the relationship between) the psychology of concept formation and the task of metaphysical analysis among other things. Another student, Ruth Lydia Saw, was a founding member of the British Society for Aesthetics. Her work concerned the thought of Baruch Spinoza, the nature of Occam’s razor, and (as the above would suggest) aesthetics. 
 
636 that what was significant about Einstein’s Eddington expedition wasn’t that his
theory was verified. After all, additional evidence might overturn Einstein the way
that he overturned Newtonian physics as the completed story of physics, just as
Hume famously pointed out that there’s nothing about the sun’s having risen in the past that precludes it from failing to rise in the future. Instead, what made Einstein a
paradigmatic scientist was that he made a prediction capable of being wrong. His
theory wasn’t verified, it was simply not falsified when the opposing theory was. The
consequence of this is that it isn’t verification that matters for science, but
falsifiability, or the ability to be proven false. Scientific theories are not proven true, but merely make predictions which can be proven false. This is, for Popper, the
characteristic feature of science.237 He contrasts it with the claims made by Marxists
and Freudians at the time. They were constantly seeing their theory being proven
right wherever they looked. In the same way, the conspiracy theorist is always seeing positive evidence for the theory’s truth. The issue is that their theories have no
circumstances under which they can be proven false, as they are always modified to
explain new evidence away. Yet, despite these issues, philosophers in the analytic
tradition remained committed to the view. Perhaps things were more complicated than the Vienna circle had imagined, but the prevailing attitude was that these
problems could be addressed. The complete dissolution of positivism would only
come later, and one of the central figures in overturning it was also central to
popularizing it in the first place. It is to him that we turn to now.
 
Ludwig Wittgenstein 
 
Ludwig Wittgenstein was born in Vienna, Austria into one of the richest
families in Europe. His father had, prior to Wittgenstein’s birth, gone from a waiter
 
237 Popper is also well known for his work in political philosophy, where was an ardent defender of liberalism. He is credited with being the first to describe the paradox of tolerance, in which he observes that if a free and open society tolerates intolerance, the intolerant will eventually gain power and eliminate the tolerant, thereby bringing about the destruction of the tolerant society. On the basis of this, Popper concludes that a tolerant society mut not tolerate intolerance. 
 
637 and sometimes struggle musician to owning what was functionally a monopoly on
Austria’s steel industry. Wittgenstein was the youngest of nine children, four girls
and five boys. While both sides of his family were Jewish, recent generations had
sought to distance themselves from that fact, and the young Ludwig and his siblings were baptized and educated within the Roman Catholic church. Their financial
privilege also allowed them to access a childhood rich in the arts, with both Johannes
Brahms and Gustav Mahler giving frequent private concerts in their house. Ludwig
himself learned to play clarinet and was known to have absolute pitch, while two of
his brothers, Hans and Paul, would eventually become prodigious musicians.
 
Despite this enrichment, family life in the Wittgenstein house was anything
but pleasant. Ludwig’s father was described as an intense and strict perfectionist who
sought total control over the lives and education of his children. Beyond this, family
relations were uptight and cold, and depression was common among its members, with three of the five Wittgenstein brothers eventually taking their own lives. The
first of these was Hans, who ran away to America and mysteriously disappeared from
a boat in the Chesapeake Bay. The second of which was Rudi, who seemed to have
taken his own life for reasons related to guilt over his attraction to men, which he had kept private for the same reason, an attraction which Ludwig shared. These
deaths motivated Ludwig’s father to allow him to attend regular school instead of
strict private instruction. Interestingly, the school he would attend would also be
attended by Adolf Hitler, who was born only six days before Wittgenstein. While it cannot be confirmed, it is likely that the two were schoolmates for at least one year.
In any event, now amongst his peers, Wittgenstein stood out for his depressive and
isolated character, his stutter, and his sophisticated manner of speaking and dressing.
 
After leaving school, Wittgenstein began his university education by
studying mechanical engineering, completing an undergraduate degree and enrolling in a doctoral program with the intention of designing and flying his own planes. As a
graduate student he was a prolific researcher, studying meteorology and developing a
plane propeller which was too advanced for its time. Throughout these efforts, his
frustrations and notable temper with the difficulties of engineering drove him to consult ever more complex and theoretical forms of mathematics. It was during this
time that he encountered the works of Russell and Frege, who had been attempting
to ground mathematics in formal logic. Seemingly overnight, Wittgenstein lost all
 
638 interest in planes and dedicated himself fully to this new line of research. He was so
motivated by these readings that he began frequently visiting with Frege at the
University of Jena to discuss his own developing ideas on math and logic.
 
At Frege’s suggestion, Wittgenstein travelled to Cambridge to work under
the supervision of Russell, showing up at Trinity College unannounced and ready to talk philosophy with Russell. He became even more obsessive during this time,
attending all of Russell’s lectures, dominating class discussions, and following
Russell around campus until late in the evening, much to his chagrin. Yet,
Wittgenstein’s written work so impressed Russell that he quickly concluded that Wittgenstein was not only a genius but Russell’s intellectual heir. With Russell’s
intellectual approval, Wittgenstein was launched out of a years-long depressive
episode. So much so that he would credit Russell with saving his life.
 
Now a proper student at Cambridge, Wittgenstein joined the prestigious
Moral Sciences Club, composed of philosophy students and faculty, immediately
becoming as domineering there as he was in Russell’s lectures. He would eventually
be asked to stop attending after complaints that he would not allow anyone else to
speak, and after a particularly infamous incident in which he brandished a hot fireplace poker at Karl Popper during Popper’s invited lecture to the society after
Popper raised skeptical concerns about Wittgenstein’s philosophical views. It was at
this point that Wittgenstein began to slip back into depression due to his own
insecurity that he had not completed a work of genius despite his single-minded
devotion to the field and due to his guilt over his depressive and sometime manic personality. Yet, it was not all bad for the young Wittgenstein, as this time period
also marked his introduction, by Russell, to a distant relative of David Hume’s,
David Pinsett. The two quickly became collaborators and lovers, travelling Europe
together and conducting research on music psychology as it concerns the perception and appreciation of rhythm. During their travels, Wittgenstein spent an incredibly
productive three weeks in a cabin in Norway and, upon their return to Britian, he
soon left again to return to the cabin on the belief that he would accomplish more
there. Early that morning, David Pinsett saw him off, and the two would never see one another again.
 
639
Back in Norway, Wittgenstein furiously developed most of the ideas that
would eventually become the foundation of his most influential work. Eventually,
he sent word back to Cambridge that he needed G.E. Moore to visit him and assist
him in completing his masterwork. However, Wittgenstein had little intellectual respect for Moore and essentially expected Moore to act as his secretary, and
frequently blowing up at Moore when he, in the eyes of Wittgenstein, was in error.
With an early version of the work complete, Moore was dispatched to Cambridge to
advocate that it should be accepted by the University as grounds for a bachelor’s
degree. Moore wrote Wittgenstein saying that it was being rejected because it was not properly formatted. Furious, Wittgenstein wrote Moore back: “If I am not worth
your making an exception for me even in some STUPID details then I may as well go
to Hell directly; and if I am worth it and you don’t do it then – by God – you might
go there.”238
 
Wittgenstein’s anger at Cambridge was soon cut short with the outbreak of
World War I. While he had a medical exemption, Wittgenstein immediately enrolled
in the Austro-Hungarian Army, a pattern of reckless danger-seeking behavior that
would persist throughout his life. He took up one of the most dangerous jobs, directing artillery from no-man’s land, and saw combat in the most dangerous
battlefields active in the war. He would go on to be highly decorated for his service in
the war, often noted for his bravery, and winning all but the highest honor awarded
by the Austro-Hungarian Army, a prize he was nominated for and ultimately denied on the grounds that his extraordinary bravery in this incident did not serve a
significant strategic purpose. These dangers seemed to have changed him, as he had
something of a spiritual awakening upon his return. On leave from the war,
Wittgenstein completed what would become his most significant work, the
Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, which he triumphantly claimed solved all of the problems of philosophy. However, things quickly made a turn for the worse when
publishers declined the work at the same time that he was informed of his uncle’s
death, his brother Kurt’s suicide, and the death of David Pinsett in a plane crash. On
top of this, Wittgenstein was immediately thrown back into the war, where he was
 
238 Monk 1990, 103. 
 
640 captured, spending nine months in an Italian prisoner of war camp until the entire
conflict came to an end.
 
Upon his return to civilian life, he began frequently discussing plans to take
his own life. Having inherited his portion of his father’s fortune, he committed
himself to disposing of the money and to becoming an elementary school teacher. He hid his identity as one of Europe’s richest men and took up an elementary school
teaching position in mathematics in a small rural village in Austria. In this role, he
became a mysterious and sometimes humorous figure, having frequent outbursts in
response to the musical performances or teachings of his colleagues. Yet, it was not all humorous. Wittgenstein’s ill temper also led to him frequently physically
punishing students for their bad work in math. He was known to cane the boys and
pull the hair of girls. He was living in a sterile one room home, eating minimal meals
of bread and butter when he was visited by a colleague from Cambridge begging him to return. In the time that Wittgenstein had been gone, the Tractatus had been
published to international philosophical acclaim, launching Wittgenstein into
superstar status. Despite this, Wittgenstein was living modestly, refusing any
financial support from his family, and sending back food they brough him. He was reluctant to return to academic philosophy until, one day, he so severely beat an
eleven-year-old boy that he collapsed to the floor. Having already boxed a girl’s ears
so hard that they bled, a parent sought to have Wittgenstein arrested. When the
police arrived, Wittgenstein had disappeared. After a brief stint in Vienna, where he worked designing an elaborate house and sometimes attending meetings of the
adoring Vienna circle, Wittgenstein returned to Cambridge, only going back to that
rural Austrian village years later to beg the children he hit for forgiveness.
 
Back at Cambridge, Wittgenstein was met with adoring fans, including the
influential economist John Maynard Keynes, and was quickly granted a Ph.D. on the basis of the Tractatus so that he could take up a teaching position there. Surrounded
by those telling him that he had, indeed, solved all of philosophy, Wittgenstein began
to worry increasingly about the ultimate success of the work, fearing that it had
actually failed, even if it would take him to show the world how. With the outbreak of World War II, Wittgenstein began to get the same itch that occupied him during
the previous war, to be near the front lines. Disenchanted with academic philosophy,
Wittgenstein sought a job at Guy’s Hospital in London so that he could, in his own
 
641 estimation, die quickly there, rather than slowly in Cambridge. He, once again, kept
his identity a secret and began working as a porter, dispensing medication to patients.
In this role, he apparently advised the patients, without any expertise on the matter,
to not take their medication. When the war finally came to an end, Wittgenstein resigned from his position at Cambridge and dedicated himself in earnest to writing
the work that would overthrow the Tractatus. He began travelling widely and
writing what would become the Philosophical Investigations. Ultimately, however,
Wittgenstein would not live to see the publication of the work as he soon died from
prostate cancer.
 
As we can see from its influence over and adoration from positivists in the
Vienna Circle and Cambridge, Wittgenstein’s early work in the Tractus fully
endorses positivism and the logical atomism that goes with it. In some ways, his so
compellingly having argued that he had solved all of the problems of philosophy was instrumental in the spread of the view. The confidence that the positivists had in
dismissing so much of what had come before them in the history of philosophy, and
in deriding what was happening in continental philosophy at the time, was rooted in
Wittgenstein’s apparent success. However, it is his late work, the Philosophical Investigations, which begins to unravel the view and truly distinguish Wittgenstein
from his peers and from the rest of analytic philosophy. In order to understand how
Wittgenstein intends to upend positivism, we must first recognize the extent that it
departed from the standard order of things in philosophy. Since the time of Yājñavalkya and Thales, philosophers have concerned themselves with the nature of
reality, with what is. Whether it is, at bottom, pure consciousness or pure water, the
‘it’ that these thinkers are talking about is our world. Even when Socrates asks
Euthyphro what the nature of piety is, and he must rely on his language to
interrogate this question, he is concerned with what piety is, not with what the term ‘piety’ means.
 
Yet, by carving philosophy up along Kantian lines, the positivists have quite
intentionally closed themselves off from the matter of what is, ceding that question
to the scientists. Instead, philosophy ought to be limited to what our words mean. In
this way, early 20th century analytic philosophy undergoes a linguistic turn, a movement away from metaphysics and toward language. As we have already said,
this is primarily undertaken in the form of conceptual analysis. Due to the advances
 
642 made by Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein in formal logic, philosophers begin to
think of providing definitions in terms of necessary and sufficient conditions. For
instance, we might think that a sandwich is, by definition, two pieces of bread with
something else in between. If this is right, then any sandwich will necessarily meet these conditions, and a thing can’t be a sandwich without them. More than this,
meeting these conditions is sufficient to make a thing a sandwich. It need not have
any additional features in order to be counted as one. Together, these necessary and
sufficient conditions pick out all of the sandwiches in existence and only the
sandwiches. This is a definition in the strictest sense, and this kind of definition is what the positivists are looking for in conducting a conceptual analysis, because they
can convert these kinds of relations into formal logic and can compute the truth of
statements on the basis of this. Wittgenstein himself pioneers some of this work in
his development of ‘truth tables’.239 While this work is incredibly interesting and productive, it exceeds the scope of our discussion here. What matters instead, for our
discussion here, is that Wittgenstein became increasingly skeptical that this is actually
how language works. However, if this is right, then we lack the resources that logical
atomism requires. The promise was that we could these definitions to build states which are verifiable by science, then we could take the results scientists offer and
compute the truth of further statements, a project that positivists were so committed
to that anything that isn’t a scientifically verifiable statement or an analytic truth is
taken to be literally meaningless.240 The meaning of a statement, as a reminder, is the conditions under which it can be verified to be true.
 
The issue for Wittgenstein is that our use of language seems to be much
more varied than what can be accommodated in Frege’s logic. For instance, consider
questions like “would you care to accompany me to the ball?” is this sentence true or
false? We could worry similarly about other kinds of sentences, like “I christen this
 
239 While Wittgenstein is often credited with developing the first truth table, and does invent the current form it takes, very similar graphic representations of logical relations were already developed by the pragmatists Charles Sanders Pierce and Christine Ladd-Franklin. 240 Indeed, by some estimations, Wittgenstein’s recommendation to philosophers when someone comes to them with a metaphysical question (for instance, what the meaning of life is) is not to try to solve such a meaningless question but dissolve it. That is, to provide a kind of therapy whereby they could come to realize that they should stop asking the question altogether. 
 
643 the U.S.S. Montana!”, “I promise I will call you back later,” or “I love the smell of a
freshly baked cinnamon roll.” The person who christens the ship isn’t describing a
fact about the world, they are doing something with language. They aren’t pointing
out the conditions under which it would be true that the ship is named the U.S.S. Montana, they are making it true by saying it. Similarly, the promiser isn’t predicting
what will happen but invited their audience to hold them accountable to it, and the
truth of whether someone likes the smell of freshly baked cinnamon rolls isn’t
scientifically verifiable or analytically true, but is true in virtue of what that persona
actually thinks. Even within the realm of propositions, the meanings of words can change depending on their context. Consider berries. When someone enters a botany
classroom, the term ‘berry’ refers to a fleshy fruit with a single seed tied to a flower
with a single ovary. On this account, an avocado is a berry and so is a jalapeño. Yet, if






you were to walk into a smoothie store and ask for a mixed berry smoothie and they were to return to you four minutes later with a 72-ounce Styrofoam cup of
guacamole, you would likely not leave satisfied. This is because there is also a non-
identical culinary definition of ‘berry’. It turns out that situations like this are
common throughout our language. Whether we count a tomato as a fruit or a dollhouse chair as a chair depends on our purposes in talking in the first place.
 
In order to illustrate this, Wittgenstein uses the example of a construction
site. One worker is building while the other is passing them materials, either a slab or
a beam. Now imagine that the worker calls out “slab!” Strictly speaking, on the predicative account of the positivists, this is not an analytic or synthetic statement
and is therefore meaningless. Yet, we know that within the practice the two people
are engaged in, this means that they are requesting the other person give them a slab.
Thus, despite the fact that this ‘sentence’ isn’t intelligible on the terms of logical
atomism, it still seems to have a meaning, and that meaning is tied to how the language is used. Wittgenstein tells us that we should understand the meanings of
words and sentences in the context of a language game. One game using the term
‘berry’ might be centered around ordering and selling smoothies where another
might be centered around studying plant growth. However, if the positivists are right, then there is an ultimate fact of the matter about what berry means outside of
these games. Wittgenstein’s response is to say that there is only meaning as use.
That is, we cannot give the kinds of definitions the positivists want, because language
 
644 is always tied to some language game, and we can instead only say how to use it
within that game.
 
We might be worried about whether and how language can function
without definitions to our words. What Wittgenstein is suggesting seems to be that
we do constantly, and are condemned to, use words we can’t even define if pressed. In this case, Wittgenstein continues his interest in games. Imagine a child who is
taught about games by being told that they can use the term ‘game’ to refer to
hopscotch, poker, and water polo. Wittgenstein tells us that any attempt to define
what a game is is doomed to failure, but that isn’t to say that we can’t talk intelligibly
about them. Here, he points us to the idea of a family resemblance. Imagine a family consisting of two parents and two children, in which the first child has their
mother’s eyes and their father’s nose, and the second child has their father’s eyes and
their mother’s nose. Obviously, the father has his own eyes and nose and the same is true for the mother. We can see these features laid out below:
 
Father:  Mother 
Eyes: Father  Eyes: Father Nose: Father  Nose: Father Child 1:  Child 2: 
Eyes: Mother  Eyes: Father Nose: Father  Nose: Mother Notice that there is no set of facial features that every member of the family
has in common. When people say that they share in a family resemblance, they don’t
mean or need there to be a set of necessary and sufficient conditions unifying the
family’s appearance. It is enough, in this case, to say that there is a cluster of features shared by the members, sometimes to differing degrees, and sometimes sharing no
full set in common with another member of the group. Wittgenstein thinks that all
of our words can unified in this way. Indeed, this seems to be true for the games the
child has learned about. They don’t share a strict set of features in common, but they share a family resemblance with one another.
 
Yet, we might wonder whether this isn’t a limited view of language too. For
instance, Wittgenstein’s model seems to recommend teaching someone the meaning
of a word by giving them feedback about whether they are using it correctly, whether it applies in any given case or not. However, what about its use in novel
 
645 circumstances? Imagine that our child above invents something of their own, a
leisure activity in which two competitors attempt to achieve victory at one another’s
expense. They want to invite a friend to engage in this with them. Are they right to
ask them if they want to play a game? The positivists, at least, think that this question can be answered in principle. There is a true definition of ‘game’. The problem, for
Wittgenstein, is that we can’t actually move from a description of how a word has
been used in some cases to a prescription for how it ought to be used.241
 
To illustrate this, consider an example. Imagine learning arithmetic as a
child.242 At first you add up small number, one and two, two and three, and three and four. You begin to learn how the plus symbol (+) is used. Now imagine that
there is another concept which looks very similar to addition. We can call this
‘shmus’. Just as a financial bank and a riverbank are both symbolized with the term
‘bank’, both plus and shmus are symbolized with the + symbol. However, shmus looks a lot like plus. It works in the same way that addition does until you reach a
number above sixteen. At that point, the point at which you have a number greater
than sixteen being shmussed with any other number, the answer is always 32,
regardless of the specific numbers involved. So, two plus two is four, two shmus two is four, two plus seventeen is nineteen, and two shmus seventeen is thirty-two. Now,
you have come upon a problem in your arithmetic homework: 13+29=. If you are to
take this as a case of plus, the answer is 42. If you are to take it as a case of shmus, the
answer is 32. Nothing about the ways that the symbols have been used in the past can tell us how we should use them in this case. We can’t derive a prescription for the
symbols used from a description of the rules for how it has been used.
 
This problem has come to be called the ‘rule-following paradox’, and for
Wittgenstein, this problem also arises in the case of our language. The meanings of
 
241 Notice the similarities between what Wittgenstein says here and the arguments made by Hume. Hume’s skepticism about induction also centers on our inability to move from the past to predictions about the future. Meanwhile, his fact/value distinction also hangs on the idea that we can’t move from a description to a prescription. All of these problems share in common that they have to do with what philosophers call ‘underdetermination’. That is, the available evidence does not settle what we should conclude between competing alternatives. 242 Saul Kripke, Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language (Harvard University Press, 1982).  
 
646 words can shift over time, becoming more expansive, drifting away, or changing
meaning all together. This fact prevents us from deriving rules for how our words
and language should be used from facts about how they are. The result of this seems
to be that we can’t discover a rule for how to use concepts in novel cases, we must decide these rules, in  the way that a referee in a nonlinguistic game must make a call.
 
These kinds of questions, about rules and their prescriptive force, would go
on to animate the work of those downstream of late Wittgenstein as well. For
instance, Elizabeth Anscombe, who was a dedicated student, a close friend, and one
of the primary English-language translators of Wittgenstein’s work, famously pushed
a somewhat similar concern about moral rules.243 Kantianism and other secular
philosophical attempts to ground morality in reason hope to tell us what we ought
to do. However, Kant has only described the apparent rules of morality. In
Anscombe’s view, a law requires a lawgiver. We can’t move from a description of Kant’s rules to the prescriptive force that the laws need to be able to tell us that we
ought to follow them. On the basis of this, she argues that morality requires God
and, like Wittgenstein seems to after his spiritual awakening, she finds that in the
God of Roman Catholicism.
 
243 Four of Wittgenstein’s other students stand out. All were a part of a small circle of students Wittgenstein dictated his lessons to and which were charged with distributing these notes to the rest of the students in these classes. These notes have been instrumental in understanding Wittgenstein’s thoughts between the Tractatus and the Investigations. Helen Knight and Margret MacDonald both would later do work in the philosophy of language and aesthetics, with Knight writing on pictorial art and universals, while Margaret MacDonald wrote on a wide range of topics, but often focusing on aesthetic language and concepts. Two others had careers more defined by interests in the philosophy of language and in Wittgenstein’s work more directly. These include Margaret Masterman, whose work concerned computation and the philosophy of science and Alice Ambrose, who specialized in mathematical logic. Also downstream of Wittgenstein is the Ordinary Language Philosophy movement, centered primarily in Oxford and (to a lesser extend) Cambridge). This movement sought to use Wittgenstein’s concept of ‘meaning as use’ to reframe the work of the philosopher. For instance, P.F. Strawson would go on to do work in the philosophy of language as well as on free-will and moral responsibility. Meanwhile, J.L. Austin’s work pioneered the concept of the ‘speech act’ (first encountered in our discussion of Aristotle), which would be influential in analytic philosophy, but also in Judith Butler’s performative theory of gender. 
 
647
Yet, despite this thorough renunciation of his earlier logical positivism, the
Philosophical Investigations do not serve the final death blow to the view. Instead, it
is a student of Carnap’s who will finally push the last remaining positivists to give up
on the project. This student is Willard van Orman Quine.
 
Willard van Orman Quine 
 
While Wittgenstein’s later spiritual awakening would lead him to be a fierce
critic of both logical positivism and the scientistic (that is, overly scientific) attitude
it takes towards truth and meaning, the other major critic responsible for the end of
the movement would actually, in many ways, argue that it had not rendered
philosophy scientific enough. Willard van Orman Quine (often abbreviated as W.V.O. Quine) was born in Akron, Ohio, where his father owned a company
specializing in manufacturing molds for tire making. Clearly, he was interested in
philosophy from a young age, as he recalls converting to atheism when he was only
nine years old. This interest would continue with him throughout his life as, after completing a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Oberlin College, he went on to
earn a Ph.D. from Harvard University. Having distinguished himself as a Ph.D.
student, he earned a fellowship which allowed him to travel to Europe to study and
meet with influential positivist philosophers abroad, including with A.J. Ayer in Britian, and Rudolf Carnap in Vienna. However, the intellectual life was cut short
with the outbreak of World War II. Quine would spend his wartime working in the
U.S. Navy in a military intelligence role deciphering German submarine
communications. Upon his return from the war, Quine would return to Harvard where he would have a long and distinguished career. Finally, at the age of 92, Quine
passed away from Alzheimer’s disease on Christmas day.
 
Quine’s most thorough and direct attack on logical positivism came in the
form of an article entitled “Two Dogmas of Empiricism.” Like Wittgenstein, Quine
was well-versed in logical positivism because he had spent considerable time as a positivist, with Carnap serving as a kind of personal mentor to him. As the name of
the article indicates, Quine sees logical positivism as endorsing two unfounded
 
648 theses, and he contends that by knocking down both of these dogmas, the whole of
logical positivism can be dismissed. Further than that though, he will offer a spiritual
successor to the view which he hopes will avoid these problems. So, what are these
two dogmas of logical empiricism? 1) the analytic/synthetic distinction and 2) the principle of verification. We can take on Quine’s criticisms of each of these in turn.
First, like Wittgenstein, Quine is skeptical that strict analyses of the meanings of our
words can be given. Quine’s argument in this case involves winnowing down the
number of cases in which an analysis might be possible and then using a burden-
shifting argument for the rest. Quine brings this discussion into focus by asking what the meaning of ‘meaning’ is.
 
The positivists and Wittgenstein have both offered accounts of meaning for
synthetic statements (that is, the conditions under which the statement can be
verified and the rules governing its use within a particular language game respectively). The issue is that if there is an analytic/synthetic distinction, as
philosophers since Kant have contended, then analytic statements are those said to
be true in virtue of their meaning alone, so we must have a separate account of
meaning in this case. What, for instance, does it mean to say that Billy is a bachelor because he is an unmarried man in virtue of the meaning of the term alone? We take
there to be a meaning relation between ‘bachelor’ and ‘unmarried man’, so what is
that relation? One answer is to say that the truth conditions for these two terms are
exactly equivalent. Any true statement said about a bachelor would also be true if we switched out the word ‘bachelor’ for ‘unmarried man’ and vice versa. In the same
way, any statement about a bachelor which is false will have the same truth
conditions as the identical statement made about an unmarried man. This sounds
quite compelling, but what about a statement like “‘bachelor’ contains eight letters.”
This statement is clearly true, but when we substitute in ‘unmarried man’, it is not. Of course, the critic will say that there is a difference between using a word (“Billy is
a bachelor”) and mentioning a word (“‘bachelor’ contains eight letters.”), as clearly
indicated by the fact that we had to put ‘bachelor’ in scare quotes in the latter case.
However, we should recall that Quine’s strategy is not to give a knock down drag out argument here, but to first winnow down the range of cases where an analysis could
work. Clearly, analysis can’t tell us anything about mention cases, but can it handle
the use cases? Even when strictly looking at use, it is not obvious that the truth of
 
649 equivalent statement is always preserved. For one thing, if you were asked to invite a
bachelor friend of yours to go on a double date with someone else, you would likely
not be met with enthusiasm when you arrived with Father John from your local
parish, even though he is an unmarried man. This seems to give us further reason to think that the meanings of our terms are often contextually dependent in the way
that Wittgenstein has claimed.
 
Beyond this though, there are other issues with substitutability. For
instance, consider a case like the identity of Batman. Batman is Bruce Wayne in the
strong sense. What is true for one is true for the other and what is false for one is false for the other. The two terms seem to be interchangeable. You cannot, after all,
punch Batman without also punching Bruce Wayne at the same time. Yet, consider a
statement like “Inspector Gordon knows that Bruce Wayne is standing across the
party from him.” When we try to substitute ‘Bruce Wayne’ for ‘Batman’, the statement is suddenly no longer true. Inspector Gordon does not know that Batman
is standing across the party from him because he does not know that Bruce Wayne is
Batman. Philosophers call contexts like this ‘intensional contexts’. The result of this
discussion is that the truth conditions of our terms are not obviously preserved across a wide range of circumstances, depending on whether we are using or
mentioning a term, depending on what purposes we have in speaking, and
depending on whether we are discussing issues involving intensional contexts.
 
Yet, there is also a deeper worry about substitutability. In this case, Quine
asks us to imagine a scientist who travels to a remote village which has never been contacted by nor contacted the outside world. Further, imagine that their language is
so isolated and distinct that it shares nothing in common with any other surviving or
known language. The task of the scientist is, in essence, one of learning the meanings
of the villagers’ words from a position of radical ignorance. Accordingly, Quine calls this thought experiment radical translation. The question left for us is that of how
the scientist might come to learn the meanings of these words. Imagine, for instance,
that they are hunting one day with the villagers when a rabbit runs out in front of
them. One of the hunters yells “Gavagai!” This could be their word for ‘rabbit’, yet it could also be their word for ‘Get it!’, ‘Prey!’, or ‘Shoot now!’. How might we tease
these possible meaning apart? The scientist could try to yell “Gavagai!” when they
see an owl and observe the responses of the hunters, or hold up a pet rabbit, point at
 
650 it and ask “Gavagai?” This will probably help to narrow down the list of possible
meanings, but Quine argues that it can’t actually get us down to a one true meaning.
The reason for this is that any circumstance where a rabbit is present is also a
circumstance in which a sequence of undifferentiated rabbit time-slices is present, and where a collection of undetached rabbit parts is present. How can we ever be
sure whether the speaker isn’t referring to these possible other meanings if we can’t
separate the presence of the rabbit from the presence of its undetached parts? In this
way, Quine, like Wittgenstein, seems to think that the meaning of our words is
underdetermined. This idea has come to be referred to as the ‘indeterminacy of 
translation’.
 
Having taken himself to have shown why the truth conditional approach to
meaning likely won’t work when it comes to giving absolute and universal
definitions, Quine now turns to other theories of meaning which could ground the truth of our analytic statements. One possible answer to the question of what it
means to say that ‘bachelor’ means ‘unmarried man’ is to say that the two are
synonymous, or that that simply is the definition of the word ‘bachelor’. The
problem is that we can turn around and ask what the meaning of ‘synonymity’ is. Here, we will likely say that it is when two words mean the same thing or that they
share a definition. Yet, this account presupposes that we know what the meaning of
‘meaning’ is, which is exactly what we were trying to figure out in the first place. It
seems that we are simply doomed to define ‘meaning’ in terms of synonymity, ‘synonymity’ in terms of definition, and ‘definition’ in terms of meaning.
Accordingly, the entire project appears to be circular. This has not shown that no
account of meaning, in the rich, strict, and universal sense needed by the positivists,
is possible per say, but Quine thinks he has shifted the burden on to proponents of
the view to clarify what it is, exactly, that they mean by ‘meaning’ when they say that analytic statements are true in virtue of their meaning alone.
 
With this, Quine can now turn to the second dogma of empiricism, the
principle of verification. Recall that this is the idea that meaning for synthetic
statements is set by the truth conditions of the statement, and that the statement is true if it can be empirically verified. We have already seen some skepticism about this
idea, coming from Karl Popper. Popper had said that science succeeds not by
verifying hypotheses but by attempting and ultimately failing to falsify them.
 
651
Popper’s idea of falsifiability emerges because he thinks that careful observation of
what scientists actually do reveals that falsification is more critical as a distinction
between the scientific and the pseudo-scientific. Yet, Quine argues that Popper
himself is not observing the scientists close enough. Consider a rather mundane experiment. Our scientist forms the hypothesis that water boils at 212°F and designs,
according to the ‘scientific method’ an experiment to test this. In this case, they will
place a thermometer in a pot of water on the stove and observe it as the water comes
to a boil, noting the temperature when it does. They watch as the temperature on the
thermometer hits 200°, 201°, and then 202°F. However, expecting the water to boil at 212°F, they are surprised to find that the water starts boiling at a mere 203°F.
Clearly, they didn’t verify their hypothesis, but did they falsify it? An actual scientist
would likely not see this observation and then announce that they have disproven
the theory that water boils at 212°F, nor should they (thinks Quine). Instead, they will check to make sure that they aren’t actually 4,500 feet above sea-level, as the
pressure might have affected the boiling temperature of their water. If they are,
indeed, at sea-level, they will now wonder whether there aren’t some impurities in
their water responsible for the disparity or, finally, whether their thermometer isn’t simply malfunctioning. We might think that this is a bad scientist because they aren’t
changing their mind based on new evidence, but Quine thinks it is more complicated
than that.
 
The first thing to say about this case is that the scientist is right that these other issues might be responsible for their results. As such, a scientist can’t just test
their hypothesis in isolation. While they may take themselves to be testing the boiling
point of water, they are also testing the hypotheses that 1) they are currently at sea-
level, 2) that the substance is the pot is water, and 3) that their thermometer works.
Of course, they could revise their belief that water boils at 212°F based on their experiment, but they could just as easily, and as rationally, revise any of these other
beliefs as well to accommodate this evidence. It seems that scientific experiments
underdetermine the results. This theory, that we can’t test a hypothesis in isolation,
is called the ‘Duhem-Quine thesis’ (named after Quine and the French physicist Pierre Duhem, who argued a similar point). This seems to raise concerns for the
positivist project, whether it uses the principle of verification or the idea of
falsifiability, as the truth conditions of synthetic statements are complicated,
 
652 contextual, and underdetermined. If we can’t articulate the truth conditions of a
statement, then we can’t get at its meaning either.
 
Where does all of this leave us? In Quine’s view, without analyticity, every
belief of ours is revisable. Since the time of Kant, philosophers have equated the
analytic truths with the necessary truths. Hume seems to have shown us that synthetic statements, like that the sun will rise tomorrow, are not necessarily true.
They are merely contingently true. Yet, thinkers could always take refuge in knowing
that the analytic statements were necessarily true, in virtue of their meaning alone. If
Quine is right that this kind of meaning doesn’t exist, then there is nothing that is necessarily true. He has, in effect, out Hume-d Hume. Indeed, Quine once famously
quipped that ‘the human condition is the Humean condition.’ It may be that
contingent, revisable knowledge is the best that we can ever hope for, and that you
get what you get, and you don’t throw a fit. This is a radically anti-foundationalist
position.244 The positivists had hoped to ground all human knowledge through
science, logical atomism, and conceptual analysis, and now Quine has declared that
there will be no such foundation. Quine endorses a very pragmatic view, perhaps a
uniquely American form of analytic philosophy in that way. Here, he harkens back to William James’ coherence theory of truth. Our statements aren’t made true by
their relationship to facts about the world, but due to their coherence with the rest of
our ideas. That is, what is true for science according to the Duhem-Quine thesis, is
true for all knowledge, because there is no clear boundary between philosophy and science without the analytic/synthetic distinction. This position, that the meaning
and truth of our statements are interdependent on one another and have no external
and firm foundation, can be called holism.
 
What Quine suggests, is that instead of thinking of all of our knowledge as
an inverted pyramid, as Descartes would, in which a small set of facts or singular fact grounds subsequent facts which grow more and more abundant as they ground their
 
244 Another prominent anti-foundationalist from this time period in analytic philosophy is Wilfrid Sellars. Sellars is famous for his work in epistemology, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of language. Sellars’ and Quine’s views, while different in some important ways, are quite similar in this regard. Sellars would be a profound influence on another analytic pragmatist, Richard Rorty. Rorty, like Sellars, is well-known for his critiques of representationalism. 
 
653 own subsequent facts, we should think of knowledge in terms of a web of belief. Where Descartes would have us hang our beliefs up, jump down to solid ground,
and interrogate them from a stable footing, Quine draws on an image developed by
Otto Neurath of the Vienna circle by saying that we must ‘fix the boat from inside the boat.’ We are adrift in a sea of uncertainty and new incoming information and, as
such, cannot dry-dock our ship as Descartes would have us do. Instead, any attempt
to repair our worldview must be undertaken from within that same worldview.
 
Yet, this model is not offered without guidance as to how to do this. In this
case, all of our beliefs are interconnected. Indeed, some of our beliefs are quite central to our worldview. For instance, everything that we know might be thrown
into chaos if we were to revise our belief in the law of noncontradiction. We can
think of beliefs like this as being at the center of the web, with many other ideas
hanging on them. While Quine thinks that every belief, including the law of noncontradiction, is ultimately revisable, we ought to try to avoid doing so, as it will
upend much of what we think. A little further out from the center we find beliefs
like that water boils at 212°F. Many of our beliefs do hang on this, even if they are
everyday (e.g., that the pot that you are currently looking at is at least 212°F, etc.), but we have held or could hold a number of others without holding this one, as
many people lived lives like our own well before this information was known.
Further out still, we have simple beliefs, such as that our thermostat works, that the
water in this pot is pure, or that you are currently at sea-level. It turns out that nothing much at all would change if these beliefs turned out to be wrong, we could
simply revise our belief and move on with our lives. Quine thinks that the rational
thing to do is, when confronted with new information which contradicts what we
believe to be true (taken as a whole), try to do as little damage as possible to the
overall web of belief, getting rid of the ideas at the periphery instead of those which provide significant structural support. He calls this suggestion the ‘principle of
minimal mutilation’.
 
654
Descartes’ foundationalism and Quine’s holism 

 
Now, between Quine and Wittgenstein, the possibility of necessary and
universal truths seems like a pipe dream. The daring ambitions of the logical positivists and their optimism about certain knowledge were, by the middle of the
century, rendered naïve and slightly embarrassing. It would seem that continental
philosophy had been vindicated. Not only had the system which excluded questions
of metaphysics failed, analytic philosophy had ended up in a similarly skeptical, limited, and contingent place. However, as quickly as positivism had been
overturned, analytic philosophy’s fortunes would shift. While positivism as a
particular movement was abandoned, the search for necessary and universal truths
and the promise of conceptual analysis would reemerge with a new generation of philosophers. Even more interestingly, in the same way that the positivists had
hitched their wagon to Kant’s analytic/synthetic distinction, the future of analytic
philosophy was soon in the hands of an even earlier thinker, Gottfried Wilhelm
Leibniz.
 
655
Ruth Barcan Marcus 
 
If Quine can be seen as the arch-nemesis of necessity, the notion will have its
champion in Ruth Barcan Marcus. Marcus was the third daughter born into secular Jewish home in New York City. She describes her parents as socialists and as
very politically active. When her father died at a young age, the women that now
made it up took a significant financial hit. This situation was only compounded by the ongoing Great Depression. Yet, Marcus still had an active and rewarding
childhood. She was a voracious reader, an athlete, and, to some extent, a rebellious
young woman. She defied expectations that she would attend an all-women’s college
when she instead enrolled at New York University. As would have been true for many philosophy students during this time, her education at N.Y.U. was deeply
mathematical and oriented around the formal logic research that the positivists had
used as their foundation. After completing her undergraduate degree, she moved on
to Yale University, where she earned her Ph.D. Her time at Yale was made difficult by the institutionalized misogyny of the school. As a Ph.D. student, she was not
allowed to enter the classrooms for the classes she helped to teach, nor was she
permitted to enter all of the rooms of the school’s library. Even as she served as the
President of the philosophy student club, she was often unable to attend meetings because they were held in rooms deemed off limits to women. It was during this time
that she also met her husband, who was a graduate student in physics. When the two
graduated, she followed him to Chicago so that he could teach at Northwestern
University. However, due to the school’s policy of avoiding hiring family for fears of nepotism, she was not permitted employment. Instead, she was forced to piece
together work through a series of grants and short-term positions, including a
prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship. During her time in Chicago, she also began to
study under Carnap and to attend conferences where she would discuss issues in
philosophy and logic with Quine and others. This lasted until she was finally hired by the University of Illinois Chicago and then, ultimately, Northwestern. Marcus
would eventually return to Yale almost thirty years after completing her PhD., and
she would remain there until her death forty years later.
 
Up until this point, the project of analytic philosophy was one and the same with the logical positivist movement, so that when positivism was slain by late
 
656
Wittgenstein and Quine, it appeared that this spelled doom for analytic philosophy
as a whole. In a certain sense, the tradition did carry on. Quineans attempted to
embed themselves further within science (where the saw no distinct boundaries
between their own projects and those of scientists) and the Ordinary Language Philosophy movement attempted to do philosophy in light of Wittgenstein’s later
work. These philosophers remained on a distinct branch of the field, not interacting
with the schools, thinkers, and methodologies that make up the continental
tradition. Yet, there was a real sense that the analytic project was dead, even if it
remained as a loose collection of different traditions with a common ancestry. This was the backdrop against which Marcus developed her theories. However, in order
to understand it and what it means for analytic philosophy, we must first step all the
way back to the work of Bertrand Russell.
 
One of the major advantages of Frege’s pioneering work which inspired the positivists to endorse logical atomism was its ability to capture the logic of
quantification. Propositional logic allows us to understand the underlying logic of
words like ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘if’, and ‘not’, but Frege adds to this list words like ‘all’, ‘some’,
‘a’, ‘any’, and ‘none’. What was missing, however, was ‘the’. ‘The’ is the definite article. ‘The dog’ is not merely a dog, she is that particular dog. One of Russell’s
innovations within predicate logic was to articulate a logic of ‘the’. In this case, he
begins by recognizing that there are particular facts about individual people which
set them apart from others and others that are quite common. Consider ‘baldness’ as a predicate. Many men are bald, and we can say that ‘a man is bald’ using predicate
logic by saying that ‘there exists a person such that that person is a man, and that
person is bald.’ This would be rendered formally as ‘ⱻx(Mx & Bx)’. The problem is
that this description is indefinite. There are many such bald men, and we have come
no closer to picking out the exact person we are talking about. How might we say that ‘that man is bald’?
 
In order to understand Russell’s answer, it might help to use a different
example. While there are many bald men, other descriptive facts about individuals
might do much more work in picking them in particular out. For instance, there is only one man who was the teacher of Alexander the Great, and that was Aristotle.
Imagine that we wanted to say that Aristotle is bald. While this description is
different in being unique to Aristotle, it is still a description. Accordingly, we can use
 
657 our account of indefinite descriptions like the one above as a blueprint to develop an
account of definite descriptions, or those which pick out the identity of the object of our statement. Here, Russell translates this by saying that ‘there exists a person
such that that person is a teacher of Alexander the Great, there is at most one person who is the teacher of Alexander the Great, and that person is bald. This could be
rendered formally as ‘ⱻx(Txa & Ɐy(Tya → x=y) & Bx)’. In short, this is to say that
‘there exists only one person who was the teacher of Alexander the Great, and that
person was bald’. Notice that this has the effect of saying that ‘the teacher of
Alexander the Great is bald’, but it does so without using the word ‘the’. While this description works quite well to pick out Aristotle, not all of us are so lucky as to have
done something so unique. In this case, the definite description which picks you out
might require listing out a long combination of descriptive facts about you (e.g., that
you have red hair, that you were born on August 2nd, 1921, that you live in Toledo, Ohio, etc.). These additions are easy to make in predicate logic because ‘and’ is well-
defined and we can simply keep adding properties until we get to the unique
combination that only you have. Russell believed that his theory of definite
descriptions gave us a way to translate names, like ‘Aristotle’, into predicate logic, that names are just disguised definite descriptions.
 
The issue with this account for Marcus, which by this time was widely
accepted, is that these descriptions are entirely contingent. There seems to be a real
sense in which Aristotle could have not been a philosopher at all and, instead, became a fisherman. He did, in actuality, serve as the teacher of Alexander the Great,
but that is only contingently true. Yet, that Aristotle is Aristotle seems necessarily
true. If names are just definite descriptions, then this fails to capture the necessity of
identity. So, what, then, are names? Marcus’ answer is that they are rigid 
designators. However, explaining exactly what that means requires us to refamiliarize ourselves with an idea put forward by Leibniz. In his theodicy, or his
answer to the problem of evil, Leibniz tells us that we must live in the ‘best of all
possible worlds’. While we may think that there is unnecessary suffering in the world
which God must answer for, it must be that the pain we experience is, in fact, necessary. Perhaps from our limited and mortal perspective we can’t see why this
pain is necessary to produce the best of all possible worlds, but God can. Marcus
realizes that the language Leibniz uses can help us to understand the idea of necessity,
 
658 and that a logic of necessity is itself necessary for capturing the necessity of identity
that we find in names. So, what does it mean when we say that something is
necessarily true? That what we are saying is true in all possible worlds. While there is
a possible world in which Aristotle became a fisherman, Aristotle was Aristotle in all possible worlds. These worlds can be defined as ways the world could be, and our
world, the actual world, is the possible world that is. We can think of possible worlds
as alternative realities. There are millions and millions of iterations of the universe in
which only one or two or three facts are different, but there is no world in which a
square circle exists. This is to say that squares are necessarily not circles, because the extent to which a shape is circular is the extent to which it is not square. The world
in which a square circle exists is inconsistent in this way and is, therefore, not
possible. This way of thinking about the meanings of terms like ‘necessity’ and
‘possibility’, in terms of possible worlds, has come to be called ‘possible worlds 
semantics’.245 This semantics allows Marcus to say that names, necessarily referring to the person they pick out, are rigid designators, because they designate that person in all possible worlds.
 
While this is all well and good, there remains the question of how this account of names could be captured using formal logic. Frege had made a huge leap
forward by introducing a system which captured the underlying logic of
quantification (e.g., ‘all’, ‘any’, some’, etc.), but Marcus expands on this by
developing the first system of quantified modal logic. That is, she creates a formal system which can capture the way that terms like ‘necessarily’ and ‘possibly’ work
which, at the same time, preserves our ability to use quantification. Most
importantly, her system captures the interaction between modality (that is, necessity
and possibility) and quantification (that is, all and some). She does this through the
Barcan formula. This tells us that ‘if it is true of all x that they are necessarily F, then it is necessarily true of all x that they are F’. Equivalently, if it is possible that
 
245 Possible worlds semantics has been incredibly influential within the analytic philosophy of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. David Lewis even went so far as to argue that the possible worlds it describes exist in actuality (as something akin to parallel universes). This position has come to be known as ‘modal realism’. Meanwhile, David Chalmers has built off of this work to distinguish epistemically possible worlds from metaphysically possible worlds and has argued for a kind of modal realism about virtual worlds. Chalmers is also well known for work drawing on notions of possibility within the philosophy of mind. 
 
659 there exists an x such that A, then there exists an x such that it is possible that A.
While the implications of this formula are both controversial and complex, the
important thing is that it allowed logicians to quantify across possible worlds and,
therefore, define the circumstances under which something is necessarily true. In turn, this could be used to counter Quine’s contention that nothing is necessarily
true.
 
Notice something interesting, however. Up until this point, necessity has
been equated with analyticity. Philosophers had so far all believed that any necessary
truth would be true in virtue of its meaning alone, but Marcus’ account of necessity does not appeal to meaning, thereby seeming to bypass Quine’s concerns. This will
have profound implications. Already, by reopening the possibility of necessary
truths, Marcus has once again allowed for the possibility of universal knowledge. We
can at least know that identity is necessarily and universally true across all possible worlds. However, subsequent thinkers would push possible worlds semantics
further. One of such thinkers is Saul Kripke, who is credited with popularizing
much of what Marcus accomplished. Kripke himself, however, would argue that we
can provide similar accounts of other, nonanalytic, statements. In this case, he tells us that the statement that ‘water is H2O’ is true in all possible worlds. If someone says
something using the term ‘water, then they are necessarily talking about H2O. The
minute they stop talking about H2O, they have ceased to talk about water. The same
seems true for statements about gold and statements about the element with the atomic number 79. This is because, in Kripke’s view, these are also rigid designators
for what we can call ‘natural kinds’, a category which exists naturally.
 
Discussions about natural kinds have been present with us for a long time.
Plato had hoped to ‘carve nature up at its joints’. Presumably these joints separate the
different kinds of things which exist naturally. This idea is echoed in the essentialism of Aristotle, who contended that each kind of thing (be it a frog, an apple tree, or a
human being) has an essence which makes it the kind of thing that it is, and which
defines its function. Aristotelian essentialism then survived through the middle ages
where it led to the debate over the problem of universals. Nominalists like Abelard denied that there were such natural kinds, instead asserting that these categories were
invented and not discovered. For instance, the category ‘frog’ is just as contingent as
the category ‘designated hitter’, there is no necessary essence which unites all on only
 
660 its members. Now, Quine had continued on in the tradition of nominalism, denying
essentialism and necessity. In this way, Quine can be seen as mirroring within
analytic philosophy the existential turn we saw in the work of Heidegger and the
existentialists. While Marcus would go on to attempt to defend a moderate form of essentialism (and to argue that necessity did not entail essentialism), Kripke’s
account became much more popular, and the analytic project could begin again.
Now, not only did analytic philosophers think they could give necessary definitions
for things (as Kripke suggested about water being H2O), but it also seemed that it is
at least possible that these analyses could get at the actual essences of things. The meanings of terms could be set based on what they refer to necessarily in the world, a
view called the ‘new theory of reference’ (or ‘direct reference’). Further than that
though, Kripke put metaphysics back on the menu, but an analytic metaphysics. In
his view, possible worlds semantics opens up the possibility of doing metaphysics through modality.
 
As it stands now, in the present day, the overall philosophical approaches of
Quine, Wittgenstein, and those downstream of Marcus and Kripke all remain active
research programs. While the logical positivist movement may have all but died, analytic philosophy remains, and it remains divided. It now stands much like the
continental tradition, a lose cluster of various approaches with a common lineage.
Some still very much operate within the paradigm of conceptual analysis, whether
that is definitional, modal, or according to family resemblance. Others have sought to do more applied work. The linguistic turn remains in some ways, but it has also
given way to an applied turn. Following Quine, many philosophers have embedded
themselves within the sciences, the arts, or other discourses and practices to make
their skillset useful, not believing that there is a unique philosophical domain of
questions they should be focused on. Even more recently, we have seen an experimental turn, in which philosophers have done the opposite, using the
methodology of the sciences to interrogate longstanding philosophical questions.
This most recent addition to the field has come to be called ‘experimental 
philosophy’.246 Finally, there has also been some signs that the divide between the
 
246 This field was pioneered by the philosopher Joshua Knobe, who first used it to describe the ‘Knobe Effect’, whereby people are more inclined to say that an otherwise identical action was done intentionally if it is blameworthy rather than praiseworthy. 
 
661 continental and analytic traditions is dissolving, but whether they can fully reunite
remains to be seen. However, in either event, almost all of this discussion has
centered on issues in metaphysics and epistemology. The progress we have seen on
these questions was matched equally when it comes to questions of value theory, especially concerning issues of social and political philosophy. We have so far
focused on the story of the soul of philosophy in the 20th century. Now we turn to
its heart.

Political & Social 
 
Philosophy 
 
As we have seen, 20th century analytic philosophy was, while in many ways a
revolutionary departure from the philosophy which came before it, still a natural
outgrowth of what had come before it in the Anglo-American philosophical tradition. Ever since the rise of mechanical philosophy, empiricism of some sort has
been a dominant force within this tradition, whether that was seen in Locke’s tabula
rasa theory of the mind, Hume’s bundle theory of the self, or the method of science
endorsed by Pierce. All of these various positions ultimately stem from a common sense that our sense perceptions are either the best or only source of knowledge. In
turn, the logical positivists had sought to cast out anything not analytically true or
not verifiable by the observations of scientists as literally meaningless. A similar
trajectory can be seen in Anglo-American value theory. The utilitarianism of Bentham had emerged as the leading theory of morality in Britian, and it would
sustain itself for some time. Even with the rise of expressivism under A.J. Ayer, an
empirically informed liberal utilitarianism, of the sort that John Stuart Mill would
endorse, would linger as the predominant political philosophy within the analytic
tradition. It is against this backdrop that an alternative emerges which will change the course of political philosophy in a major way. While liberalism, in some form,
will continue to hold a majority of minds, how this initial sentiment is realized and
expressed exactly will become much more varied, as the entire grounding for political
philosophy is overturned and redefined. We will also see other major works defending views to both the left and right of liberalism.
 
665 
These philosophers, like many of those that came before them, see the
central project of political philosophy as falling largely along the lines of Plato’s
Republic. In this case, that means that the role of the political philosopher is cast as
one of imagining the most idealized and just form of government, what the best sort of society would look like, with the expectation that we will strive towards it. This
form of political philosophy can be called ‘ ideal theory’. It will dominate the middle period of the 20th century. However, in this scenario, little attention is paid to
facts about the actual goodwill of the citizens involved. Perhaps Plato’s republic
would have looked very different if we had imagined its inhabitants as starving to the point of cannibalizing one another. The noble lie can only carry a society so far once
the people who make up that society begin to evaluate their neighbors in terms of
their being well-suited for the braising pan. By the same token, entrenched religious
or ethnic conflicts might render it practically unhelpful to say that the ideal form of governance will be one in which both parties are committed to mutual cooperation.
We might reasonably ask, under the circumstances, whether political philosophy
can’t tell us something about how to get from here to there or, less ambitiously, how
to even address this conflict in the first place. This kind of work has come to be
known as ‘non-ideal theory’, as it represents what justice may look like under non-ideal conditions. Non-ideal theory will emerge in the late part of the century as a
major force within the field. Non-ideal theorists will turn to questions of how to
address racial and gendered injustices among other very real social ills. In turn, this will lead to a blossoming of feminist philosophy across the late 20th and early 21st
centuries. We turn, now, to the story of 20th century social and political philosophy
and the lessons learned from it.
 
Ideal Theory 
 
The tide of utilitarianism within 20th century analytic political philosophy
was largely pushed back due to the efforts of one philosopher, John Rawls, and in
particular, one book: A Theory of Justice. Rawls’ principal concern within the book is
the problem of distributive justice. That is, the problem of how goods are distributed
 
666
within the circumstances of justice.247 If 1) people within a society disagree about
how resources should be used and 2) there is not enough for everyone to get their
way, then we must come up with some fair principle to follow in distributing these
resources. Rawls’ answer, in this case, is to say that the best principle is one which all rational parties would consent to. So, would we all consent to the principle of utility
(maximizing overall happiness)? To help us think through this question, Rawls
provides a thought experiment. In this case, we imagine making this choice from
what he calls the ‘original position’. Think of society as a kind of game that we are all
going to play. Within that game, different characters may or may not have different rights, opportunities, levels of wealth, and all of the other things that contribute to
their sense of self-respect. However, we are not yet playing. Now, we are not our
characters, but ourselves, and we are deciding how to distribute these things (what
Rawls calls ‘primary goods’) amongst the characters once the game starts. We might be a plumber in real life and, accordingly, we might want the plumber to get all the
money and fame, but what if we aren’t the plumber in the game? We would likely
regret giving that character all of the cash and social esteem on the table. If it turns
out that our characters are randomly assigned, what would be the ideal strategy prior to starting the game? Rawls asks us to think about which principle of distributive
justice we would endorse for society if we didn’t know what role we would play.
That is, we are to determine what rules should be in place within our society under
conditions in which we don’t know what race, gender, sexual orientation, disability status, or religion we will be in life. By the same token, we do not know whether we
are going to be hard working or not, addicted to drugs or not, intelligent or not, or
whether we would have any number of other personal features. Our occupations,
whether we would have a family or not, and whether we would be allergic to cats are all stripped away to give us a ‘view from nowhere’. Imagining that we only know that
we are rationally self-interested and want to give ourselves the best chance at a good
life, Rawls tasks us with thinking this question through. This thought experiment
can be called the ‘veil of ignorance’.
 
When Rawls looks at the principle of utility from behind the veil of ignorance, he is worried. First, consider that, according to utilitarianism, everything
 
247 While Rawls references Hume in discussing the circumstances of justice, we have already seen them come up in discussing Marx and Han Fei as well. 
 
667 other than overall happiness is merely instrumentally valuable in attaining it. If
justice does not maximize happiness in a given case, then justice must be thrown out.
If rights are not convenient for maximizing happiness, then they too can be
discarded. It may be that harvesting peoples’ organs while they sleep maximizes happiness overall in some cases, but would you consent to that if you weren’t sure
whether you would be the person whose organs are taken or their grieving mother?
Probably not. For this reason, Rawls formulates his first principle of justice:
society must guarantee each person’s basic rights and as many basic rights as are
possible for everyone to have at the same time. Your right to swing your fist around must end somewhere (namely, at everyone else’s face), because asserting otherwise
would mean giving up the rights of others not to be hit. However, whatever we can
give a person which can be enjoyed alongside everyone else getting their rights, we
should secure. This, for Rawls, has to be the foremost principle, as no other principle should be able to overrule it the way that the principle of utility might want to.
 
Yet, this is only a first step towards a theory of justice. It has not told us, for
instance, how goods should be distributed. Some may say that now that we have
addressed the possible gross injustices of utilitarianism, we can use the principle of utility to distribute goods, as long as it is constrained by the first principle. Rawls is
skeptical once again. Imagine a scheme in which there is a wide wealth disparity
between the richest members of society and the poorest. You might think that the
idea of being rich is so exciting that it is a risk worth taking to consent to this society. However, because there is a chance that you could be the worst off person in society,
and because the consequences could be so severe and fundamental to our well-being,
Rawls argues that a rational agent ought to constrain themselves once more. While
it’s tempting to go for the biggest reward, to maximize expected utility, this is only
because we aren’t fully able to imagine, from behind the veil of ignorance, how bad
having nothing actually is. In this case, he endorses the maxmin principle (sometimes referred to as the ‘difference principle’ or ‘second principle of justice’).
This tells us that we should only tolerate inequalities when they are necessary to
benefit the worse off people in society, just in case we happen to be one of those people. To illustrate how this could happen, consider our giving special privileges to
medical doctors. We want there to be plenty of doctors around, and we want the
best doctors possible as well. Accordingly, it may be that we can attract people to this
 
668 very demanding profession by making it so that physicians get paid well. This also
encourages smart and driven people to go into medicine. Thus, even though medical
doctors are paid more in this case, this difference is to everyone’s advantage, even the
worst off among us.248 While this may not justify the exact cost of healthcare in our society, it might still justify some inequality. If it turns out that this income
inequality doesn’t actually maximally benefit the poorest people in society, then
Rawls thinks that it is rationally optimal to abandon it in favor of equality.
 
Beyond these principles, however, Rawls tells us that justice will look quite
different in different societies. It may be that it is maximally efficient for all parties in a city under siege for a single ruler to dictate everything, while a free and stable
society is most efficiently governed through a democratic process. In this way, he has
not offered us a precise form of government but a range of just possibilities, and the
constraints which define that range. As long as we satisfy these two principles of justice, we can leave behind the veil of ignorance and return to society, where our
actual interests can lead us in whatever direction they want. As to the problem of
political obligation, or why we ought to comply with whatever government emerges
from the two principles of justice in our case, Rawls grounds this obligation broadly, in a requirement that we work to establish and comply with just institutions, which
happens to include governments which adhere to the principles of justice.
 
Yet, Rawls is only the first word in the explosion of political thought during
this time period, not the last, and he will be confronted by opponents from both his
left and his right. Perhaps the most well-known of these critics is Robert Nozick. We first encountered Nozick in discussing his experience machine thought experiment
as part of an objection to John Stuart Mill’s utilitarianism. However, hedonism’s
willingness to throw out reality is not the only reason he is at odds with utilitarianism
and thinking about why will help us to understand his problems with Rawls. In this case, Nozick’s primary concern with utilitarianism is that it doesn’t allow for any real
rights, much less the natural rights that Nozick wants to endorse.249 Nozick follows
Locke in arguing that we have basic natural rights to life, liberty, and property. Also
like Locke, Nozick defends the labor theory of property. That is, individuals can
 
248 This situation is what economists refer to as a ‘Pareto efficiency’. 249 Recall Jeremey Bentham decrying natural rights as ‘nonsense on stilts’. 
 
669 come to own things by mixing their labor with them. The problem for Nozick, then,
is one of seeing what government could be justified in light of these rights. Here, he
adopts Locke’s basic liberal picture but adds an additional upper bound on how
much a government is permitted to do. In this case, Nozick argues that we should
prefer historical principles instead of end-state principles (sometimes called ‘patterned principles’). An end-state principle will pick out a particular pattern of
distribution as the most ideal. For instance, the maximin principle tells us that we
should distribute resources so that, in the end, the worst off among us is maximally
benefited. Meanwhile, Marx argues that we should distribute goods according to the principle that we take from each according to their means and give to each according
to their needs. Both of these views share in common that they see a particular end-
state as ideal. By contrast, Nozick claims that as long as the procedure we use to
generate a pattern is just, whatever pattern it produces will be just. In turn, whether a given procedure is, in fact, just is simply a matter of whether the chain of transfer of
goods which brought it about historically is just. This is why these principles are
called ‘historical principles’, and Nozick’s theory will provide us with a set of
historical principles just as Rawls provided us with two principles of justice.
 
Imagine that we are operating from a state of nature. In following Locke,
Nozick has told us that everything in nature is owned in common, and individuals
can come to justly own parts of it by mixing their labor with those parts. This is what
he will call the ‘principle of justice in acquisition’. After this, surely these individuals are free to exchange goods consensually as gifts or in trades. As long as the person
giving an item acquired it justly, they are free to give it away (at cost or not) and the
recipient obtained it justly. This person can then turn around and continue the
chain of transfer for as long as they do so justly. This is what he will call the
‘principle of justice in transfer’. With these two principles, Nozick is ready to argue against Rawls.
 
Rawls had told us that we were only justified in tolerating inequalities when
they benefit the worst off among us (the maximin principle). To argue against this,
Nozick will develop a thought experiment. Imagine a small model world with only a million inhabitants. To begin with, each person is given five dollars, justly and fairly
(thereby satisfying the principle of justice in acquisition). However, one of those
people happens to be basketball legend Wilt Chamberlain. Chamberlain is so skilled
 
670 at basketball that all the other inhabitants are more than willing to pay twenty-five
cents to watch him shoot around. They agree to exchange this money freely and
thereby satisfy the principle of justice in transfer. Yet, at the end of the game, we have
now ended up with a pattern in which 999,999 inhabitants have $4.75 and Wilt Chamberlain is walking away with $250,005. This distribution is not egalitarian in
that it is not the case that everyone has the same amount. Likewise, the maximin
principle will probably tell us that the situation of the worst-off person is not
maximized by this distribution. The problem is that we can’t exactly point to where
things went wrong. To Nozick, all there is to the question of justice is whether people who are entitled to make decisions about their resources make them
consensually. Beyond this, whatever inequality emerges is just because it is the
historical result of a just procedure. He thinks that this case has shown us that any
government attempting to redistribute this wealth, returning some of the money to the original owners to achieve more wealth equality, is undoing a just procedure. To
attempt to ‘correct’ this inequality is to violate the consent of the people who
brought it about of their own free-will. Thus, according to Nozick’s Wilt 
Chamberlain argument, the government is very limited in what role it can play. Here, Nozick limits it to the role of securing the rights and safety of the people who
it governs over. This position, that the government should be limited to what is
necessary to protect the most expansive scheme of individual rights, can be referred
to as libertarianism (not to be confused with the theory of free-will which shares the same name).
 
If Nozick can be seen as the century’s greatest advocate of libertarianism,
and Rawls is its biggest defender of liberalism, G.A. Cohen is one of its most
formidable proponents of socialism. In contrast to Nozick, who thinks Rawls’
analysis goes too far, Cohen holds that Rawls doesn’t go far enough. Cohen’s concern centers on the difference principle. Rawls’ justification for the principle was
that there are certain circumstances in which an inequality might be maximally
beneficial for everyone involved, even the worst-off people. As an example of this, we
have discussed our paying physicians more than those working lower class jobs. The story is that by paying medical doctors more, we all benefit from having the best and
brightest at the helm of our health. The extra income provides the incentive, in this
case, for talented people to enter the profession. The issue, as Cohen sees it, is why
 
671 exactly paying these people extra does provide such an incentive. Recall that ideal
theory overall is predicated on the idea that everyone within a society is trying to
cooperate towards a maximally just system. Given that this is a precondition, Cohen
asks why these talented people need this extra incentive. If they truly do believe, in earnest, that inequalities are only justified when they are strictly necessary for
bringing about a maximal improvement in the lives of the worst off (as the maximin
principle would have us do), then they would ask whether this incentive is necessary
to motivate themselves. In turn, they would answer that it is not, because they could,
just as easily, not withhold their labor without additional unequal compensation. That is, they have the choice of applying their talents to the health of others at equal
pay or doing so at increased pay. This means that they could simply take the job at a
lower pay rate. As such, the incentives Rawls describes are not really necessary at all,
which in turn means that the inequality in question fails the maximin principle. In Cohen’s view, Rawls’ model smuggles in an assumption which regards the
preferences of talented people as, essentially, a force of nature which must be
accounted for and worked around. The reality, he tells us, is that the difference
principle is self-defeating once we are talking about well-intentioned people.
 
So, what is Cohen’s own view of what a fully just society would look like?
Here, he actually agrees with Rawls to a large extent. To Cohen, Rawls’ model gets
right that it is fundamentally not fair that people’s lot in life can be determined by
factors beyond their control. Just like those behind the veil of ignorance in the original position, none of us picks our race, our disability status, the family we are
born into, or the sex we are assigned at birth. What country we are born in, the time
period in which we are born, and the genes our parents give us are all things that we,
ourselves, won’t decide, and which will play an enormous role in the way our life
turns out. It is significantly easier to live a rich and comfortable life if you are a white cisgendered man born into a wealthy family in the modern U.S. than if you are not.
Yet, whether this is true is simply a matter of luck. The job, then, of a just society, is
to correct for this luck, so that what you get out of life is fundamentally and
completely the result of your own free choices. This view, which Cohen endorses, is
called ‘luck egalitarianism’. However, what this looks like, exactly, is a matter of debate. One could endorse a number of policies or forms of government in trying to
realize that goal. In Cohen’s case, luck egalitarianism is realized through a form of
 
672
Marxism. Yet, while he does endorse the basic structure of Marx’s view, he remains
quite critical of many of Marx’s individual positions and of much of contemporary
Marxism. In trying to work out a version of Marxism that would satisfy the rigors of
analytic philosophy, Cohen plays an important role in the rise of the aptly named ‘analytical Marxism’ school. While the views of the various philosophers who make
the school do differ in some important ways, we can generally see it as an attempt to
remove the influence of Hegel (that is, dialectics) from Marx’s work. Beyond his,
analytical Marxists also tend to adopt a kind of methodological individualism. Where
Marx had sought to analyze all social phenomena (be it a part of the base or the superstructure) through the lens of a larger class conflict, analytical Marxism sees
these social patterns as ultimately and essentially reducible to the behavior of
individuals. If the dominant class does something, it is not, in this view, because the
class dynamics at work within the larger mode of production demand it, but because the people who make up that dominant class decide to do it. Of course, like in all
other areas of philosophy, not all analytical Marxists endorse both of these claims
(e.g., methodological individualism and the denial of historical dialectics), but these
do contribute much to the school’s family resemblance.
 
Finally, the last of the major ideal theorists of the 20th century does not
actually come from within analytic philosophy, but from the continental tradition.
In particular, it is a thinker from the Frankfurt school, a group which we first
encountered in discussing the influence of Freud on continental philosophy. The philosopher in question, only a second-generation member loosely affiliated with the
school, is Jürgen Habermas. In a single sentence, the project of the Frankfurt school is to use the theories of Freud to revise the work of Marx. In particular,
scholars from the school are primarily concerned with explaining why Marx was
wrong in his prediction that capitalism would fall in the 20th century in favor of socialism. Freud’s utility here is in providing a psychological theory of false
consciousness, and the philosopher’s role is in analyzing culture (the superstructure)
to better understand the ways that our culture breeds false consciousness, with an
eye towards obtaining class consciousness. However, perhaps because he is only a peripheral figure in the school, Habermas does not seem to draw as heavily on the
thought of Freud or of psychoanalytic theory in general. Nevertheless, he is
interested in addressing the deficiencies he sees in Marx. On his view, Marx’ error is
 
673 in thinking about the base of our society. Marx, like Adam Smith and the French
physiocrat school, analyze these issues in terms of political economy. That is, the
system which makes up the base of our society is, for Marx, a unified political and
economic system. There is not a clear boundary between these things. Further, because Marx believes that the engine of history is class conflict, he can be drawn
into giving priority to the economic side of things. Indeed, the material conditions of
our society are ultimately responsible for everything downstream of them, and Marx
sees essentially everything as downstream of them. This has the effect that there are
no purely political problems. If it looks like our political system is the reason for some social issue, it is actually an economic issue which has led to that political
problem and anything short of a solution to that economic issue is merely a
temporary bandage. For Habermas, this fact about his theory is exactly what renders
Marx incapable of recognizing the problems with his predictions. That is, there are genuine political problems.
 
So, what model does Habermas propose if not Marx’s? Where Marx had
two systems at work in society (the political-economic base and the cultural
superstructure), Habermas sees three: the economic system, the political system, and the cultural system. Here, there is no fundamental priority between these systems.
Indeed, there can be issues in a society which are ultimately and definitively rooted in
politics and not economics. Yet, like Marx, he does think that most of our social and
cultural maladies are explainable in terms of these other systems. For instance, when the hippies of the 1970’s drop out of society to do drugs, and a culture war between
the generations ensues, bringing cohesion to the society will not be a matter of a
social or cultural cure, but either a political or economic one. The problem, as
Habermas sees it, is that the hippies have dropped out of society because they don’t
see the political and/or economic order as legitimate. When one or both of these systems fails (perhaps because there is no clear sense of how to advance economically,
or because there isn’t a sense that the views of the younger generation about the war
in Vietnam will adequately be considered by the legislature), the dissatisfaction of the
people will become manifest in the culture. Habermas tells us that a functioning society requires the ‘legitimation’ of the political and economic systems, and that
social problems are bet thought of as ‘legitimation crises’. In turn, the project of ideal
 
674 theory is one of working out what would have to be true in a society for it to be
universally seen as legitimate.
 
In this case, Habermas divides policies into two categories: those concerning
the general interest of a society and those that concern private interests. In the first
case, some things seem clearly in the interest of everyone involved. Take climate change as an example, it is in everyone’s interest that we keep the planet inhabitable.
Accordingly, the only question of legitimation here is whether the economic and
political systems do what is clearly in our interest to maintain that environment. It
doesn’t even make sense, as far as Habermas is concerned, for someone to doubt the legitimacy of what is obviously good for all. What of other issues though, of issues
which might only be of private interest to some members of society? Here,
Habermas tells us that a legitimate society will handle these issues through ‘public
reason’. To understand this, consider an example: helping the poor. Many people are highly motivated to help the poor because of their deeply held religious beliefs.
Accordingly, they may lobby the government to provide social services to these
communities and families. However, because this is a political solution, involving
wielding the power of the government and public resources, they must justify the policy in terms that will be taken by the public as reasons to do something. While it is
great that their religion has compelled them to help out, not everyone in the country
believes in their religion. It’s fine if that is their private motivation, but we need to
hear a reason which we would also endorse. Luckily, in this case, we all care about the suffering of others, so they can simply appeal to that. Whatever political process is
involved in passing this policy, it should involve a discourse of public reasons to
arrive at that conclusion if it wants to be seen as legitimate. Even if all but a small
minority in a particular society endorses that religion, it is not enough that the
majority gets what they want, but that they get what they want on grounds that everyone can take to be legitimate reasons. When private interests can be realized
through this procedure, then they are fine to pursue. Which private interests are
pursued will differ from society to society, and over time, but justice here lies, once
again, in the procedure which brings a state about.
 
Yet, there is still one wrinkle in Habermas’s account. People in the minority
can be coerced in sometimes subtle ways to take things as reasons which they might
actually endorse. This is true for anyone involved in any kind of power imbalance.
 
675
Imagine, for instance, that your employer asks you if you would like to participate in
a fundraiser and appeals to their own Christianity as a reason for giving. It may be
that everyone in the workplace but you shares in those religious beliefs, but are they
public reasons? It is easy to feel compelled, given your boss’s power over you or given how outnumbered you feel, to agree with him. Further, on the basis of this, everyone
might walk away thinking that, within this little society of the workplace,
Christianity is a public reason, even though it really isn’t. Habermas avoids this
problem by saying that the real question is what we would all take as public reasons
in an ‘ideal speech situation’. That is, free from any of this coercive pressure, and in a position where everyone feels open to express themselves freely. Thus, it is not
merely a majority or even a consensus voting yes on a policy that makes it just. It is a
matter of whether the deliberation that went into that policy passing was authentic
and free. This system can be called ‘ deliberative democracy’.
 
However, even as Rawls, Nozick, Cohen, and Habermas used the twentieth
century as a canvas for a wide range of influential work in ideal theory, others sought
to push philosophy beyond it. One of those most critical of ideal theory was Charles 
Mills. At the core of Mills’ critique is the everyday observation that, to use one example, there is a wide gulf between the United States’ origins as an attempt at
realizing the Enlightenment liberal values of figures like Locke and Rousseau and the
actual outcome for women, people of color, and many other marginalized groups.
Obviously, on some level, it is not the fault of Locke that people after him would agree with his statement that we are all entitled to a natural right to life, liberty, and
property and, at the same time, turn around and allow some humans to own other
humans. In this sense, the founding fathers of America simply failed to fully realize
the Lockean liberalism that they set out to. Yet, perhaps there is an issue at heart in
our philosophical theorizing that makes failures of this kind more likely. Recall that Rawls’ veil of ignorance asks us to imagine an idealized model world which we could
shape and consent to before arriving in it. In the same way, Rawls asks us to make
decisions about this world from a ‘view from nowhere’. We all, in our actual lives,
have a point of view about things which emerged from our own experiences. These experiences, in turn, were shaped by our religious beliefs, our gender identity, our
race, our disability status, and so many other factors. While Rawls asks us to strip
these idiosyncrasies away until we are reasoning from the bit of ourselves which we
 
676 all share in common, how can we really know that we have achieved that perspective.
Is it even possible to strip these factors away or do we merely imagine what it would
be like to not have them from the very perspective we are trying to step outside of? In
this case, trying to do the exercise that Rawls is describing may be akin to asking, on Kant’s model, for someone to imagine the noumenal world. Sure, we can speculate
about it, but we are condemned to the skewed view of it provided by the categories.
 
Mills’ concerns follow a similar line. By positing a world free from the
various kinds of prejudices which we find in the actual world, we set the inhabitants
of the original position up to run into the same sorts of problems the early American government did. The failures of this government were rooted in its partial
compliance with its own values. While the Lockean can say that Locke has an answer
for this, in insisting that all people actually do have a natural right to life, liberty, and
property, the sense that the idealized theory already addresses the issue of racial and gendered questions of justice will make it less likely to actually be addressed. Imagine,
for instance, a world in which America’s founding government was exactly the same
and endorsed the same ideal political values but also added on top of that intellectual
structure, an account of racial justice. Mills question is how it serves members of marginalized groups to keep the conversation of justice fully abstracted and
operating under the assumption of full compliance. That is, we need nonideal
theory. We need individual accounts of the principles of justice as they concern real-
life issues of race, gender, disability, religion and so on. Yet, this is still not far enough. Recall that Rawls very much operates within the social contract theory
tradition. The underlying basis of Rawls’ political philosophy is the question of what
we would, did, or should consent to, in the same way that it is for Hobbes, Locke,
and Socrates. This assumption is cooked into all of these accounts. The project of
political philosophy is one of justifying why we did, would, or should consent to the establishment of a government or to the laws it writes. Fundamentally, governance is
a social cooperative enterprise. Yet, the African slaves who were brought to America
and inhabited it were not consenting to fall under the jurisdiction of the government
they were subject to. They were most definitely not participants in a social cooperative enterprise. Accordingly, the assumption we are describing is one which,
according to its very structure, renders political philosophy as not for them. Instead
of finding themselves as a party to a social contract, they are the subjects of a racial 
 
677 contract. Despite the lofty theoretical ideals which may be marshalled out in defense of the government which subordinates them, the circumstances of their life are most
directly defined by the apparent agreement between those in the dominant class to
make them exceptions to those ideals.
 
In terms of Mills’ first project, theorizing about oppression as it is in the world, much work has been done since the publication of Mills’ critiques of Rawls
to do just that. To be clear, we have already seen plenty of work in feminist
philosophy and the philosophy of race which does this kind of work and did so prior
to Mills (take Ida B. Wells as just one example of someone doing both at the same time). Accordingly, Mills’ greatest contribution wasn’t as much him convincing
people to do it, but in providing a robust defense of the necessity of this work prior
to, after, and potentially instead of ideal theory. Mills endorses a kind of
particularism about social issues. Instead of hoping for a completed abstracted theory of justice as such to solve every issue under the sun, Mills sees it as a better
strategy to provide accounts of patriarchy, white supremacy, and other forms of
oppression separately, which can better accommodate the various ways these
phenomena manifest in the actual world. However, this isn’t to say that we can say something about oppression as such, as it exists as a general category. One pioneering
work on this front is Iris Marion Young’s “Five Faces of Oppression”.
 
Like Mills, Young argues that ideal theory misses something important. In
this case, Rawls sees the question of justice as fundamentally about the distribution
of primary goods. While he is giving, on some level, an account of distributive justice, this does not stop him from saying that justice, in general, is a matter of
fairness in the way that he describes in his work. By contrast, Young tells us that
there are plenty of injustices which do not concern the distribution of goods. These
things all fall under the umbrella of oppression. We are oppressed, for Young, when we are barred (in full or to some degree) from fully expressing our needs, thoughts,
and feelings, or from developing and exercising our capacities on the basis of our
membership in a social group. Here, social groups can be thought of as collections of
people which are characterized by a distinctive culture or way of life. While it may seem that this is a rather limited view of what kinds of social groups are oppressed (or
of what picks them out), Young has an answer to this worry. These groups need not
be real and may be defined, in some sense, by other factors. For instance, if the
 
678
President of the United States came out tomorrow and announced that all people
with freckles would now be regarded as second-class citizens, freckled people would
likely eventually become a social group of the kind Young describes. For instance,
they would likely begin to have a shared experience that those without freckles wouldn’t. This experience would naturally encourage them to associate more with
one another because they would want to share strategies for navigating life, would be
set aside from the general public, and, as such, would be drawn further into a
common way of life. In this way, oppression can reify social groups. Indeed, this is
likely what happened with racial categories in America. Various peoples from around the world with their own distinctive ethnic and national identities and languages
were put in together in a situation in which outsiders do not recognize these
distinctions. Instead, members of a racial group share a common experience in virtue
of a fundamentally unreal category. Meanwhile, without the requisite laws, freckled people do not constitute a social group on Young’s model, because there is nothing
currently driving them towards a common way of life or a sense of community. As
such, prejudicial behavior towards freckled people would not, in our current
political and social environment, constitute oppression, even if it is still a bad thing to do.
 
So, if we now have a theory of what a social group is and downstream of
that, what oppression is, what can we learn about oppression? Young is a pluralist
about it. Like Mills, she does not think oppression always looks the same in every case. Yet, there are common forms that it can take across these various cases. Young
specifically outlines five of these, which she calls the five faces of oppression. Importantly, this list is not exhaustive, but her hope is that by providing accounts of
these five faces, we can better recognize them and understand how they work when
they arise in our lives. First, there is exploitation, which Young defines largely on Marx’s lines. It is the process of transferring the results of one group’s labor to
another. Of course, we might think of Marx’s discussion of the transfer of wealth
from the working class to the ownership class as an example of this, but there are
others. The value of domestic work that many women do over and above the men they are in relationships with might be seen as a case of exploitation as well, for
instance. Second is marginalization, which Young argues is a matter of a social group
being cut off from useful participation in public life. To illustrate what Young is
 
679 thinking about here, consider the situation that elderly people find themselves in
within our society. With America’s decline in third space, social gathering spots
outside of the home and work, and having left the workforce, the elderly are often
relegated to isolation within their homes, cut off from an active public life. We see the same thing when it comes to the disabled. Without accommodation or universal
design, people with disabilities can be excluded from public spaces, sometimes with
increased barriers to entry and sometimes being blocked entirely. Next, Young details
powerlessness, the third form of oppression. Here, members of a particular social
group are cut off from participating in the decision-making which governs the conditions and outcomes of their lives. One example of this might be the fact that
minor children are largely left to the whims of their parents and, insofar as they
aren’t, it is the result of constraints placed on their parents by a government which
those same children have no say in electing. In much the same way, workers often have no say in decisions within the company they work for, which are left either to
management or ownership. Fourth, we find cultural imperialism. Young’s definition
of cultural imperialism tells us that this occurs when one social group’s experience or
culture is universalized. We can think here of the process of ‘Californication’, by which the cultural dominance of Hollywood movies and television has led to a kind
of cultural flattening. Regional accents are lost as new generations pick up their
speaking patterns from international media and entire languages are being lost due to
the ubiquity and necessity of English. Finally, there is the most straight forward form of oppression, violence. When violence, emotional harm, or threats of violence are
directed at someone due to their membership in a particular social group, it would
count as an instance of oppression. Obviously, there are plenty of examples of this,
such as lynchings during the Jim Crowe era or the increased violence faced by black trans women today.

Yet, while she has given us the tools to recognize and understand five of
oppression’s faces, Young leaves the task open to us to think about further forms it
can take. Indeed, this is precisely what has happened over the course of 20th and 21st
century social philosophy. One standout example of this is Miranda Fricker’s
development of the concept of epistemic injustice. Of course, we are familiar with the term ‘epistemology’, which refers to the study of knowledge, so what does justice
or injustice mean when it comes to knowledge? In this case, Fricker tells us that an
epistemic injustice occurs when someone is wronged in their capacity as a knower, and this can happen in at least two ways. First, there is ‘testimonial injustice’. This
happens when someone’s claims of knowledge are unfairly ignored or downgraded
on the basis of their identity. For instance, many women’s testimonies are not given
the credibility that they deserve when compared to a man’s. This happens frequently in cases where a man victimizes a woman but is not believed when she reports the
crime. However, a case need not involve an official testimony like a court case to be
an instance of testimonial injustice for Fricker. We can also look at women’s
experiences in the workplace, where it can be quite common to have their own
 
681 contributions overlooked and sometimes even requiring a man to repeat them in
order to be properly heard. Similar stories can be told about the ways in which
society or individuals might downgrade the credibility of people on the basis of race,
disability status, or any number of other factors.
 
Yet, while testimonial injustices are fairly straight forward to understand, Fricker’s second type of epistemic injustice is a little trickier. Hermeneutical injustice
occurs when people from a marginalized group lack the conceptual resources to fully
understand or express their experiences. One example of this might be the situation
of women prior to the development of concepts like ‘mansplaining’ or ‘gaslighting’. Without a concept picking these phenomena out as distinct, each individual woman
might think that their own experiences with these things are isolated instances or
idiosyncrasies of their own experience. Yet, with the concept in hand, women can
better understand that what they are experiencing is a gendered phenomenon, communicate with other women about their shared experiences, and advocate for
the injustice of these practices. In the same way, transgender people used to be
thought of as ‘transvestites’. This concept, with its name referring to the vestments
that one wears, construes trans experience as one of erotic crossdressing. With only this concept to understand their own experience, trans people were often left to
think of themselves as isolated and perverse individuals engaging in an inherently
sexual act, and not as a community of people with a shared social identity which is
neither shameful nor sexual. Of course, these are only a few examples, and these are
only some of the ways in which someone could be wronged as a knower.250 What’s
more, epistemic injustice is only one area in which the project of working out
nonideal questions of justice plays out today. This is especially true within feminist
philosophy, where a wide range of new perspectives and new ways of thinking have
been introduced in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. We can turn to this literature now.
 
250 The feminist philosopher Kate Manne has also done work exploring and ‘engineering’ other concepts which seek to make clear areas of hermeneutical injustice. In particular, her concept ‘himpathy’ concerns the disproportionate empathy given to men who victimize women.

Contemporary Feminist Philosophy 
 
Where we last left the story of feminism, Simone de Beauvoir had played a
major role in helping to bring about its second wave, which focused on the economic
and political rights of women beyond suffrage. However, recall that Beauvoir was
skeptical of the possibility of women truly flourishing outside of man’s shadow if
they were resigned to a life spent as a housewife in bad faith. This general attitude towards domestic life and the feminine role that was attached to women’s domestic
status was eschewed by second wave feminists in favor of an effort to show that
women are not and should not be excluded from traditionally male or masculine
roles. This stance, hostile towards domesticity and femininity, fairly or unfairly, came to characterize the second wave of feminism. This was until a third wave rose
to prominence. This new form of feminism emerged, in large part, as a response to
the public and institutional dismissal of Anita Hill’s testimony during hearings over
his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in the 1990’s and her allegations of sexual harassment towards Thomas. Accordingly, much of the focus of feminism’s
third wave was on issues of violence and sexual harassment, and on reproductive
rights. However, there was also a conscious effort to distance feminism from the
kinds of associations described above. The general outlook which emerged from feminism’s third wave was that domesticity and femininity had been unfairly
maligned by some second wavers. The emphasis, they argued, should be placed on
women’s agency, and that women should be empowered to choose whether to
embrace femininity or not, domesticity or not, marriage and motherhood or not, and so on. Girlhood and sexual liberation would be celebrated in the third wave of
feminism (for the most part), and traditionally girly or feminine things were not to
be downgraded simply for their association with women. This, of course, only
represents the broad strokes of a very diverse and nuanced field.
 
Beyond the third wave, a fourth wave of feminism also emerged during this time period. In this case, during the early 20th century. This movement continued
much of emphasis on social issues and reproductive rights that we saw in the third
wave, but with a much stronger sense of intersectionality. This term, developed by
Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, refers to the framework for analyzing the ways in which an individual person’s experiences are not only shaped by their various
 
683 identities (gender, race, class, disability status, etc.), but also by the intersection of
these identities. This is to say that, for instance, a disabled woman does not
participate in the woman experience and the disabled experience, but in the disabled
woman experience. To illustrate, consider the experiences of American chattel slavery by enslaved men and women. Both the enslaved man and the enslaved
woman experience racism in this system, but they experience it in very different
ways. An enslaved woman like Sally Hemings has unique forms of oppression, in this
case sexual ones, put upon her by the plantation owner who subordinates her. At the
same time, both the enslaved woman and the wife of the plantation owner face gendered oppression, but they too have very different experiences of it. This means
that we cannot truly understand the nature or shape of racism or sexism without
understanding these phenomena at their intersection. Indeed, any feminism that
attempts to understand women’s issues at a level of commonality will miss these intersectional forms of gendered oppression. A similar point can be made for
analyses of race which do not appreciate the gendered forms that racism can take,
with the same being true for issues of disability status, sexual orientation, class,
nationality, and so on. All of these social identities provide us with unique experiences, and they interact with one another to bring those experiences about. As
such, it makes little sense to talk about the female experience or the disabled
experience, as there are a number of female and disabled experiences. Anything
attempting to be more universalizing than that, intersectionality tells us, is inherently reductive, and these reductive stories tend to benefit the dominant class at the
expense of the marginalized. The increased centrality of intersectionality during the
fourth wave of feminism has meant that feminist scholars during this time have
often focused in on issues as they concern particular intersections, doing work on misogynoir (the oppression of black women), transmisogyny (the oppression of
trans women), and on other intersections of identity-based oppression.251
 
However, intersectionality was not the only approach to resolving these
issues developed during this time period. The tendency of the feminist movement to
be dominated by a reductive analysis centering the experiences of wealthier white women has not gone unnoticed. As far back as the first wave, we have seen black
 
251 These two concepts were developed by Moya Bailey and Julia Serano respectively. 
 
684 feminist thinkers providing accounts of the apparent whiteness of feminism and
advocating for new modes of analysis when examining and fighting gendered
oppression. For instance, Sojourner Truth, in her “Ain’t I a Woman?’ speech
addressing the Ohio Women’s Rights Convention in 1851 takes the women’s rights movement of her day to task for ignoring the oppression of black women. Similarly
intersectional points were made in the work of Anna Julia Cooper and Ida B. Wells
as well. By the same token, the abolitionist Maria W. Stewart pointed out, even a
few decades before Truth’s speech, the ways in which black experience interacted
with class and gender.252 Yet, whole new approaches were developed as well,
including advocacy for womanism rather than feminism. This position, developed by Alice Walker, seeks to decenter gender altogether. Instead of thinking of being a
woman as an identity alongside one’s racial and sexual identity, Walker’s womanism
views gender as a lens through which one experiences their own individual identity. The idea, at least in some theories, is that the only way to truly ensure that the
experiences of black women are not forgotten is to abandon the idea of womanhood
as an identity around which to organize and merely view it as a modifier of a deeper,
more central identity. In this case, the emphasis is placed on the virtues which emerge out of the particular experience of black womanhood. While she does not use
the term to describe herself, Audre Lorde’s work advocating for the inclusion of
black and lesbian women within the feminist tradition is also often seen as part of
the womanist tradition.
 
Outside of this, contemporary feminist philosophy also saw the
development of several different ethical frameworks. Feminist ethics begins with a
few critical assumptions. First, as you might expect, it is assumed that women are the
moral and intellectual equals of men. Beyond this though, feminist ethics seeks to
 
252 Additionally, while the word ‘intersectionality’ was not used, similar ideas have a long history of being explored within Latin American feminist thought. For instance, these themes are explored in the work of Afro-Dominican thinker Ochy Curiel who, in addition to playing a pivotal role in the women’s movement in the Caribbean, endorsed a form of political lesbianism. This position argues that women’s liberation can only come through lesbianism, which is seen as a political position rather than an identity or sexual orientation. Political lesbianism was popularized in the anglophone world in 1981 by Sheila Jeffreys, though the general sentiment has its roots in the second wave of feminism as far back as the early 1960’s. 
 
685 center the experiences, issues, and perspectives of women within ethical theorizing.
Consider, as an example, Aristotle’s moral philosophy. Aristotle provides us with an
account of virtue ethics but notice what virtues he takes as his central examples. In
this case, it is exactly those we might expect from a fan of Homeric Greek stories about masculine heroes. Courage and fortitude stand out as primary virtues in his
account. Should we find it surprising then that Aristotle did not think that women
and men were equals? His theorizing seems to privilege the perspective of men. This
seems to raise the question of what a moral theory would look like that centers the
views, concerns, and values of women.
 
One such theory was developed by bell hooks. hooks’ love ethic argues that we should center love in our moral theory, rather than notions of rights,
consequences, or virtue. What would such a difference mean? First, notice that love
cuts across all of the dimensions of society. If morality is fundamentally a negotiation of rights between different rationally self-interested parties (as a Kantian might
claim), it is going to be difficult to capture our obligations to one another within our
family life. After all, we don’t tend to argue that our spouses are violating our rights.
Yet, it does seem that ethical philosophy should have something to say about how the members of a family ought to treat one another. Second, notice that love is
reciprocal and grounded in a relationship. Where utilitarianism might tell us that we
are obligated to consider the suffering of those that harm us even if they don’t
consider ours, an emphasis on love will capture the sense in which our obligations to one another are tied together. In the same way, where virtue ethics centers the
character of an individual person, a love ethic would focus less on what you should
do and more on the way that we should be.
 
Another, similar, approach to feminist ethics is that advocated for by Nel 
Noddings. According to her ethics of care, morality does not center on rules (as deontology would claim), outcomes (as the consequentialist would claim), or
character (as the virtue ethicist would claim), but on relationships. In particular, on
caring relationships. To illustrate, consider a silly case. You are walking down the
street when you pass by your mother’s house. However, instead of simply walking by as you might normally, you notice that the house is on fire. You rush in, kick open a
door, and find your mother coughing on the ground. You immediately toss her over
your shoulder and carry her outside before plopping her safely on the sidewalk.
 
686
There, in your arms, your mother looks up at you and coughs, saying “thank you.”
In response to this, you look down and say, “of course mom, I always and only act
according to that maxim whereby I could, at the same time, will it to be a universal
law.” Of course, this would be a silly thing to say, but it is, for the Kantian, instrumental to your sense that you needed to save her. Recall that Kant thinks that
we must act out of our moral duty and that our moral duty is to obey the principle
of universalizability. Yet, this reaction to your mother might strike you as strange.
Perhaps utilitarianism gives us a better answer in explaining that you simply didn’t
want her to suffer. However, her suffering is only as important as anyone else’s, so you were just as obligated to run into any house and save whoever happened to be
there. Virtue ethics goes further still in capturing what we might normally expect as
the appropriate response. In this case, you can say that you felt obligated to rush in
because what kind of person would you be if you didn’t? What, then, does the ethics of care tell us? You can tell your mother that of course you rushed in to save her,
she’s your mom! That is simply reason enough. The ethics of care tells us that caring
relationships are reason enough to be moral, we need not think about rights or
outcomes or virtue.
 
One of the interesting things about this approach is that it is a partial theory
of morality. That is, it is not impartial. There has been a standard assumption within
moral philosophy since the time of Mozi that ethics ought to be impartial, that we
ought to treat the rights or suffering of everyone equally. However, I we are obligated to others in virtue of our relationship with them, then we might owe more
to our mom than a cousin, more to a cousin than a neighbor, and more to a neighbor
than a person on the other side of the world. Where utilitarianism might struggle to
justify our taking our own kids to have fun and celebrate their birthdays while so
many other kids around the world have so little, the ethics of care tells us that we are not wrong to prioritize our own child over strangers. In the same way, what our
obligations look like will be highly individualized. What you owe your dad might be
different from what someone else owes their dad, because your relationship to your
dad is different than theirs and, as such, may involve a different level or form of care.
 
Unfortunately, as a critic of care ethics might point out, this particularism
might mean that the ethics of care can only tell us very little about what we owe
others. Part of our goal in developing a moral theory is for it to give us some
 
687 guidance, but if it is so highly individualized, the answer for what we ought to do in
any case might be that it depends. This is, to many, unsatisfying. Yet, advocates of
the theory might tell us that we simply get what we get, and we don’t throw a fit.
Sure, Kantianism and utilitarianism will give you specific answers in every case, but that does not make them the right answer. If it turns out that the ethics of care is
right, then these systems hold no authority. It may be that we want a theory to give
us the answers, but it may also be that that is expecting too much from the reality of
our human situation. Notice, as well, that a similar point could also be made about
virtue ethics, which struggles to give us specific guidance in particular situations.
 
Another worry concerning the ethics of care’s partiality is how it relates to
questions of justice. For the Kantian, justice is, to a large degree, morality at scale.
Political justice concerns questions of rights and so does individual moral behavior.
A similar story can be told by the utilitarian, for whom utilitarianism can function just as easily as a political theory as it does a moral one. If the ethics of care is partial,
however, following a similar line would mean potentially advocating for a partial
system of justice, which is a bridge too far for many. Finally, we might also wonder
how the ethics of care can ground an obligation to help those on the other side of the world. Utilitarianism tells us that their suffering matters as much as our own and
must be considered at all times, but we do not, in any meaningful sense, have a
relationship with people whom we don’t even know the name of. Yet, we probably
still think that people in well-off countries are obligated to help those in needy countries. How we might move from the ethics of care to an obligation to strangers
across the globe remains to be seen, but the ethics of care is still a very recent
development within the history of philosophy, and does not have the head start
which deontology, virtue ethics, and consequentialism have had (all theories with
their own shortcomings and challenges as well). Indeed, advocates of the theory work today to sort out answers to these problems in the same way that other feminist
ethicists work to develop their own frameworks and even work within existing
frameworks like deontology and consequentialism.253 
 
253 The ethics of care has also been influential outside of moral philosophy, as Yuriko Saito gone on to develop an aesthetics of care, based on a synthesis of this work alongside Japanese aesthetic theories.  
 
688
While what we have surveyed here is only a small part of the enormous,
interesting, and growing field of contemporary feminist philosophy, it should be
enough to give you a sense of the state of the scholarship. In the same way, we have
gotten a taste of contemporary social and political philosophy, analytic philosophy, and philosophy more generally, but it is a taste which brings us to the present day.
Recall that this book is only intended as an introduction to philosophy and its
history. Within every chapter and each section there are nooks and crannies which
open out into massive libraries of scholarship. While we have covered quite a bit,
there is still much of the history of philosophy and current work in the field that we have left unexplored. This, too, is the birthright of every human. The reader is
invited to take up and utilize that right and hopefully feels like they are now well
prepared to do so.

Conclusion 
 
At last, we have arrived at the present day, and hopefully with some sense of
how we, as a species, came to our current way of thinking out of a world shrouded in
mystery. Philosophers today busy themselves with the puzzles which remain in the modern rationalist and scientific worldview. For instance, those concerning the self,
consciousness, morality, beauty, and justice. The project is, in many ways, to
reconcile the objective realm of atoms, causes, laws, genes, and brains with the
phenomenal realm of value, meaning, goodness, and experience. Philosophy also, every day, sees new problems emerge based on new technologies. Artificial
intelligence, genetic modification, and the many more innovations of science present
us with novel questions about what it means to live a meaningful, wise, and moral
life within a just society. The same is true for each new aspect which arises within our ever more complex and varied social world and our many new modes of life. All of
these new phenomena have contributed to the development of analytic philosophy’s
‘applied turn’, for instance. Yet, both analytic and continental philosophy remain
active and vibrant traditions in the present moment.
 
Beyond these puzzles, however, philosophy now is in a period of self-reflection. Like almost all human enterprises, philosophy has historically been
dominated by the class of people who hold power. As early as the ancient Greeks, we
have seen that the ability to spend one’s time concerned with the starry sky above
and the moral law within is a luxury most often reserved for the wealthy and privileged. Philosophy in the present day is in the process of bringing in the insights,
experiences, and perspectives of those who have long either been excluded from it or
marginalized within it. Despite the ambitions of many great thinkers to reflect back
to us an objective view from nowhere, we still find a number of critical assumptions smuggled in. Historically, these assumptions have been tied to the experience and
 
691 acculturation of the dominant class within society. Yet, the fish do not recognize the
water they live in, and so it takes an outside perspective to reveal what has long been
assumed. This is the pernicious nature of ideology. How might philosophy have
developed differently had every experience been present at the table? This is a question which current and future philosophers must struggle with.
 
In the same way, the project which we mentioned at the start, of bringing
together the various threads of philosophy around the world and spinning them into
a single stronger yarn, remains. While individual traditions have provided us with an
incredible scaffolding to work with, the free flow of information between these traditions ensures that key insights in one do not lie dormant and forgotten, nor
missed by another. Philosophers today must and will work to make sure that the
tools established there might be used to solve puzzles here, and that the insights of
then may be informative to us now.
 
Yet, while philosophy continues on, as a kind of collective inquiry under
conditions of radical uncertainty, and in which little consensus can be found,
particular patterns do emerge. We have seen these waves of thought crest and flow,
ebb and crash into one another, swirling off into new pools, which flourish, grow stagnant, and erode away under new pressures (both from society and from within
philosophy). As we have seen, philosophical progress often comes not by answering
the questions of a particular philosophical paradigm, but by upending the entire way
of thinking underlying it and thereby rendering its puzzles uninteresting in the face
of new ones. We can only assume that this will continue to be true, but it is still too early to say whether and how this might happen to us. The reader of this text may be
the one to push our understanding forward with regards to the persistent puzzles of
today, making a science of morality, consciousness, or beauty. However, they may
also be the person whose thoughts knock over the tower of modernity and replace it with something wholly new and even more radically beautiful.
 
In either case, it will help to know the landscape of the mind and the tools
and resources at our disposal to cultivate it. Hopefully this text has given the reader
that. As we said when we first began our journey, these tools cannot be taken away from you, and they are enough to do something meaningful and of value. These are
the technologies of thought, the raw materials out of which we build new wisdom,
 
692 and they are the hard-fought birthright of every clever animal spinning around our
pale star. Perhaps then, Marx’s dichotomy is a false one. It is true that philosophers
have so far focused themselves primarily on understanding the world, but to draw
out and distill wisdom from the fog of doubt is, at least in some small corner of history, to change it as well. As inheritors to the great invention of knowledge, this is
our charge.

About the Author 
 
Emmie Malone is Associate Professor of Philosophy at Lone Star 
College in Houston, TX. She completed her B.A. in philosophy at the 
University of Houston-Downtown in 2015, her M.A. in philosophy at the 
University of Houston in 2017, and her Ph.D. in philosophy at the University 
at Albany, SUNY in 2022. She also serves as the President of the Rocky 
Mountain Division of the American Society for Aesthetics. She is currently 
editing two other texts, Waves of Thought: A Global & Historical Philosophy 
Reader (which is designed as a companion to this book) and a forthcoming 
introductory aesthetics coursebook (co-edited with Elizabeth Scarbrough). 
Her primary area of research is in aesthetics and the philosophy of art, with a 
special focus on how artists and audiences engage in communal aesthetic 
practices, regulate aesthetic concepts, and develop unique ethical norms. This 
work tends to focus on the metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics of genre, 
popular music, and fashion. Outside of this, she also has teaching and 
research interests in the global history of philosophy (especially relating to 
Aztec philosophy and the history of women in philosophy), philosophy of 
gender/queer theory (especially relating to trans philosophy), and applied 
ethics (relating to the ethics of art, artificial intelligence, and trans issues).
